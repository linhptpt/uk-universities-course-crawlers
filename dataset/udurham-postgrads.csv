To critically analyse background literature within their chosen domain in order to set their work in context.  To enhance written and presentations skills in a scholarly fashion.    Content  Students are expected to choose a project from a list offered by potential supervisors.  Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topics they address and in the type of approach required; the common factor is that they are research-led and have a strong data science component.  Projects may be practically or theoretically based or both.  Projects are open-ended and contain considerably more work than can be achieved in the available time. Students therefore need to evaluate the problem domain and propose the elements of the greater problem they will address.  One of the main outcomes of the project is a significant academic-quality report.  Successful completion requires good organisation, communication and management skills.  Management is the responsibility of the student, in regular consultation with the supervisor.

Aims  To explore the environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the management issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation.  Firstly, it explores the processes of developing strategy and making strategic choices in order to develop a critical appreciation of the organisation and the environment.  Secondly, it examines how organisations seek to implement strategy via integrated marketing management.  Finally, the Module considers how managers deliver strategic plans by effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature is the way in which the Module not only conceptualises the strategic pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.

Aims  To provide students with the opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation at an advanced level of an issue which is applicable and relevant to business and/or management.   The positioning of the dissertation at the end of the programme is intended to promote integration of material covered in the core and elective phases.  The dissertation should be theoretically underpinned and should normally involve undertaking empirical research, but may be a critical essay that draws upon academic literature.  Content  Students can choose to pursue either of two types of dissertation: a business project in which they work with a host organisation;  an issue-led investigation which is not focused on just one organisation but instead examines a management issue by, for example, conducting and analysing a survey of  practice in a number of organisations.  The topic (which is formally approved by the Board of Examiners) should be one that is suitable for in-depth investigation.  MBA dissertations have typically been based in a wide variety of organisations, including: profit-seeking companies in both manufacturing and the service sector; nationalised industries; public agencies and local authorities; non-profit seeking organisations; global multinationals; and owner-managed small firms.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically analyse a specific issue or area of management or business in depth and to explore its significance in practice.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically apply knowledge and different forms of reasoning to form a discriminating analysis of issues currently being experienced in specific organisational and business contexts;  be able to conduct an independent piece of advanced research, over a longer period of time than has been possible on the programme hitherto, thereby further developing analytical and research skills needed to explore business and management problems in depth;  produce a substantial piece of written work demonstrating critical analysis of a specific issue.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  have further developed the skills of self-organization and motivation in managing time and activities in working to a deadline.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Each student is allocated a supervisor to provide support throughout the dissertation phase, assisting with any queries, providing advice where appropriate, and monitoring progress towards achieving the learning outcomes.  Supervision is normally provided at a distance and may be conducted by email, telephone, post or fax.

Aims  Leaders are the key to the successful implementation of cultural change.  Having established the level and skills of the management team and the staff in the Leading Your Team module, this module seeks to ensure that the people are right for the future.  In addition it will look at enhancing management skills to communicate more effectively with customers, stakeholders and staff during the implementation of the change.  This module is intended to provide students with the leadership skills for developing strategic policies relating to recruitment, selection and training and develop strategies based upon recruitment procedures, involvement techniques and national standards.  This module also develops techniques to rectify process weaknesses and to redesign processes in line with strategic needs and to facilitate decision-making regarding process improvement.  The module also considers processes and people in terms of the implementation of strategy and the complex changes associated with this.  Content  The content of this module is set with a medium organisation or department perspective and covers the following areas:  Strategic Human Resource Management and Development including such issues as recruitment, competency frameworks, personal development and succession and exit strategies  Team and individual performance management and measurement  Conflict management and problem solving techniques including coaching, counselling, grievance and discipline  Negotiating techniques  Culture: concepts and models including cultural types, webs and icebergs  Cultural change models including unfreezing the existing culture and identifying drivers and restrainers of change  Leading people through change including understanding transitions and resistance  Project managing the change process  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students should have:  A critical understanding of the link between culture and HR policies and practices  A critical understanding of the links between strategy, culture change and project management  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module, students should be able to:  Critically review their own organisational culture and make it explicit through tools such as the cultural web.  Formulate strategic Human Resources processes that accurately reflect the role, nature, scope, purpose, lines of accountability, career development opportunities and working environment.  Critically evaluate the level of development of team culture in the organisation.  Critically reflect on how business culture impacts on change and critically review the strengths and weaknesses of people and supporting systems.  Identify the complex internal and external forces that act for and against changes, thus arriving at planned strategies for managing changes.  Develop a critical appreciation of the conflicting styles of project and departmental management during the change period.  Critique project proposals and plans, accepting the complex and unpredictable nature of major projects and the management issues this can create.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module, students should be able to:  Critically appreciate the role of written and verbal communication during change.  Critically appreciate that written policy and actual practice may not be the same in organisations.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Lectures and seminars, supported by guided reading, will be used to introduce and explore the key concepts and theories.  Role plays, case studies and groups exercises will help them develop their own synthesised models which the assignments and mentor support will then help them adapt and apply to the specific needs of their own organisation.  Established questionnaires will be used to help people identify organisational culture.  Case studies and groups exercises will help students develop their own synthesised models which the assignments and mentor support will then help them adapt and apply to the specific needs of their own organisation.  Specific exercises are used to allow the practice of application of appropriate performance measurement tools.  Students would also be able to learn from the experiences of other course members concerning the management of change a broad business and focused team or departmental levels.  The summative assignment will require the student to analyse the Human Resource practices of their organisation and to recommend improvement to their internal processes in relation to the modules discussed and their own organisational culture.  This will be compared with best practice examples within medium sized organisations and departments.  They will also consider how change impacts on the performance of the people they work with.  This assignment allows students to consider the practical application of the subject covered and allows students to reflect on the learning from the certificate stage of the programme.  The presentation specifically addresses the key skill of verbal communication and addresses the SSK by allowing students to reflect on their critical understanding of the links between strategy, culture change and project management.

Aims  Students will analyse the external and internal environments to anticipate how the organisation will meet the competition both now and in the future.  They will obtain a more holistic view of the organisation and its competitive environment and set a realistic and pragmatic strategy with clearly identified Critical Success Factors and projects to support it.  For strategic management students need to be able to predict the financial consequences of their decisions and to be able to respond quickly to any indication that the strategic targets are not being met.  This module introduces predictive financial models and key financial indicators to meet these needs.  In medium sized organisations and departments leaders and managers need to be more aware of the financial consequences of their decisions and the impact of these on all three financial statements.  Content  The content of this module is set with a Medium Enterprise perspective and covers the following areas:  Strategy definitions, processes and challenges  Using, analysing and synthesising a number of traditional strategic models in a medium sized organisation or department context: Environmental Analysis; Value Chain analysis; Resource Audit; SWOT; Growth/Share Matrix; Product/Market Matrix; Competitive Forces Analysis.  Developing an effective Mission Statement  Identifying Critical Success Factors and developing appropriate projects to achieve them, for example using matrix mapping methodologies  Key financial indicators and the nature of costs  The impact of strategy on profit, working assets and operational cash flow  Visual Representations of key financial indicators including trend analysis  Predictive models and target calculation for key financial indicators for changes in price, costs, volume, and working assets  Capital Expenditure Appraisal models e.g. Payback and DCF  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students should be able to:  Critically understand the link between strategy and finance  Critically understand the role of computer modelling systems to predict and proactively manage the impact of cost, price and volume changes resulting from the strategic planning process.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module, students should be able to:  Research and critically evaluate a variety of external and internal influences affecting competitive ability by using frameworks for strategic analysis.  Critically review the financial impact of strategic plans  Lead the process of cascading broad, company 'mission' into critical factors of success and key strategic projects.  Critically evaluate the need for a system of information analysis and decision-making consistent with designed time pressures.  Set overall strategy in a way that will guide month to month management and responses to events, which have not been anticipated.  Lead the communication of strategic and financial information in a way to reflect styles and needs of differing groups in their organisation.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module, students should be able to:  Communicate the rationale behind strategy to organisational stakeholders  Communicate the intended financial outcome of the strategy using numerical and visual representations  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Lectures and seminars, supported by guided reading, will be used to introduce and explore the key concepts and theories.  Group exercises, financial exercises and groups discussions will help them develop their own synthesised models which the assignments and mentor support will then help them adapt and apply to the specific needs of their own organisation.  A major Case Study exercise will allow students to develop the key financial indicators by translating existing financial information and the application of decision based computer modelling to assess the feasibility of their strategy.  The summative assignment will require the student to identify and / or formulate their own organisational strategy.  They will be asked to use, analyse and critique strategic models.  They will be asked to consider the implication of strategic change on their organisational processes and people.  They will then identify their own dynamic indicators.  They will be asked to analyse these historically and, a result to set appropriate targets for the identified strategy.  They will be asked to produce and interpret the visual representation of the financial performance of their business.  The assignment also allows the students to reflect on the learning from the certificate stage of the programme and to combine this with their strategic analysis and financial decision making.

Aims  This module helps the students stand back from the task and examine the current processes within their organisation and to see how systematised they really are.  The operations within any organisation involve key and sub-processes that involve inputs an outputs across business areas/functions. It is important to be able to identify what these are and how their efficiency and effectiveness can begin to be measured. This module aims to help the participants identify core processes and be able to map their flow through the organisationâ€™s operations, highlighting where critical decisions are made and where performance should be measured.  Content  The content of this module is set within a medium sized organisation or department perspective and covers the following areas:  The concept of control and management control systems;  Quality management including concepts such as TQM, EFQM and learning organisations;  business process analysis, mapping and improvement;  the changing world of work;  organisational development and structures;  the management of organisation crises;  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students should:  Be able to characterise aspects of organisational development and recognise the stages of transition appropriate to their own organisation;  Critically review quality initiatives, their merits and purpose in benchmarking performance from which to build;  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module, students should:  Be able to critically evaluate the impact of cross functional issues within key business processes;  Show a critical understanding of techniques for mapping process activities using the knowledge and involvement of staff and live documentation;  Be able to design a process map with employees to agree current sub-process ownership and the factual, and more sensitive issues about process inefficiencies/ineffectiveness (duplication, multiple communication lines, lack of knowledge, poorly managed sub-activities);  Be able to set appropriate performance targets for processes and assess performance against these;  Key Skills:  Be able to critically review, identify and analyse the underpinning key processes of business redesign and of how to gain involvement, participation and commitment of staff. Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Through the management profiling feedback and discussion, there should be increased understanding and knowledge of generic management challenges facing everyone in the group (although practical examples will obviously differ). Experience exchange may have provided options for networking and collaboration.  Lectures and seminars, supported by guided reading, will be used to introduce and explore the key concepts and theories.  Established questionnaires will be used to help people identify organisational stage of development.  Case studies and groups exercises will help them develop their own synthesised models which the assignments and mentor support will then help them adapt and apply to the specific needs of their own organisation.  A major role play exercise allows students to develop the process mapping techniques from prime documents to final flow chart. It reinforces some of the learning from the Leading Your Team module concerning the importance of communication skills in extracting the appropriate information from staff.  A formative assignment will enable students to think about the impact of stage of development on organisational performance.  The summative assignment will require the student to analyse their current internal processes in relation to the modules discussed and their own stage of organisational development.  This will be compared with best practice examples within the Medium Enterprise sector.  They will also consider how what they are and what they do, impacts on the performance of the people they work with.  This assignment allows students to consider the practical application of the subject covered.

Financial exercises and bespoke case studies will help them develop their ability to apply the various techniques and calculations in a wide variety of circumstances.  Directors and senior managers in medium sized organisations and departments need to be able to understand the origination, calculation and interpret the presentation of financial statements.  This modular unit provides participants with understanding and knowledge of traditional financial reporting, providing them with the ability to compile and interpret reports and understand limitations and conventions.  After developing this basic understanding of accounting convention and financial reporting, directors and senior managers must effectively analyse the data for decision-making purposes.  this modular unit gives students the ability to use the tools and techniques of financial analysis which influence key decision, making throughout budgeting, investment, costing and pricing processes.  The summative assignment will require the student to analyse the Financial Systems and Financial Reports in their own organisation and comment on how these aid (or not) the organisational decision making process.  This assignment allows students to consider the practical application of the subject covered.  Progressive completion of the Learning Log allows progress towards achieving  learning objectives to be monitored throughout.

Corequisites  None.  Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  Effective marketing begins with a grounded understanding of how and why customers behave as they do.  Locating itself at the interface between the psychology and marketing disciplines, this module therefore examines three types of behavioural relationship of crucial importance to the successful management of marketing activities: the behaviour of customers in the marketplace; the behaviour of marketers toward their customers; and the behaviour of firms in the competitive environment.  Specifically, through a combination of lecturers, case studies and practical exercises, this very applied module develops a comprehensive behaviour-analytical framework with which marketing managers may seek to better understand, predict and control customer responses to the products and services of everyday life, and to the marketing of those products and services, in both consumer and organisational buying contexts.  Content  Explanatory fictions - the traditional view of customer decision making (and what's wrong with it).  New wine in new bottles - marketing as the behaviourist views it.  Pavlov and his dogs - what all marketers need to know about classical conditioning.  Little Albert and Johnson's Baby Powder - the legacy of John Broadus Watson, ""advertising guru"".  Re-opening Skinner's box - reinforcing brand loyalty.  Customer rules - verbal behaviour and marketing communications.  Controlling the scope of customer choice - how to manage the sales environment more profitably!  The behavioural perspective model - a framework for the modern marketing manager.  The things that marketers do - an operant view of marketing strategies.  The marketing firm and how to manage it - what the competitive environment is really all about!  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will have developed:  an advanced understanding of the psychology of individual, situational, environmental and cultural (inter-personal) influences on customer behaviour;  a critical appreciation of the choice processes that customers engage in when determining what to buy and where to buy it, together with the role of marketing stimuli in shaping such choice processes.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will have developed:  the specialist skills needed to successfully develop and evaluate marketing strategies in light of knowledge of applied behaviour analysis and marketing psychology theory.  Key Skills:  Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy.

The course will explore the interplay between these forces and discuss frameworks/tools that managers can use to shape or influence the process of technological change.  This course will address the macro and micro aspects of the relationship between technological change, knowledge, management and strategy.  This is designed as a level 4 elective module, building upon topics introduced in the core modules of the MBA.  This is not a technical course addressed to engineers, scientists and R&D people only. This course is for everybody curious to understand how innovation and technology change the context in which company live, prosper and die and what managerial and strategic tools/techniques managers have to control and shape to their own advantage the direction of change. Innovation is about the emergence, diffusion and application of the most powerful competitive force: new technologies. However, change comes in disguise and we often fall pray of Charles Duell's mistake (Charles H. Duell: Commissioner of the US Office of Patents, urging president William McKinley to abolish the Patent Office in 1899):  ""Everything that can be invented has been invented"",  with the consequence that organisations engage in management of incremental change rather than embracing radical approaches.  Content  What is breakthrough innovation? - static models of innovation: ""technology-push"" and ""market-pull"" models, invention and innovation, radical and incremental models.  The evolution of breakthrough innovations: evolutionary models and Christensenâ€™s disruptive/sustaining model of innovation.  The diffusion process and the danger of the â€œchasmâ€: traditional and social network-based approaches to diffusion of innovation.  New product development: how to manage technological innovation within organisations; a review of the historical approaches to new product development.  Current trends in the management of innovation including:  â€œbrokeringâ€ and modularity in breakthrough innovation; emergent innovation and self-organisation; open innovation; the role of communities and lead-users; innovation markets.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students will have a critical understanding of:  the dynamics of technological change and its evolutional properties;  the basic principles of knowledge management.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students will be able to:  critically evaluate techniques for the management of technological innovation within organisations.  Key Skills:   In addition, students will have the opportunity to further develop the following key skills:  Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy;  presentation of complex topics;  group interaction and group dynamic;  case studies analysis.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module Learning outcomes will be met through a combination of lectures, groupwork, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading.  The written assignment will test students' understanding of relevant concepts and their ability to apply and interpret what they have learned to the analysis of a particular issue in depth.  The group presentation will test students' ability to work effectively in collaboration with others and to critically assess the relevance and validity of others' views.

Aims  To explore in depth the complex environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the key issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation from the standpoints of two core areas of activity: marketing and operations management.  Firstly, the module begins by exploring the network of exchanges between buyers and  sellers in a market economy and the particular role of marketing in facilitating those exchange relationships.  This is then followed by an exploration of the extent to which the organisation-customer interaction is wholly dependent upon effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature of the module is the way in which it not only conceptualises the pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.  Content  The module takes an integrated perspective on two core areas of business activity:  Marketing:  the contexts of marketing; the consumption experience; building relationships; creating â€˜solutionsâ€™; brand selection and brand management; the movement of space and time.  Managing Operations: operations strategy; product and service design; quality management; process design; planning and control; supply chain management; operations improvement.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should have:  developed an integrated and critical appreciation of the key business areas that need to be managed in a competitive operating environment to achieve a holistic view, the emphasis being on process and integration rather than functional 'silos';  developed a critical appreciation of the dynamic pressures of the environment, both internally within the organisation and externally;  developed a critical understanding of the existing theoretical knowledge based on key areas of marketing and operations management.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should:  be able to apply their understanding to the analysis of complex issues in marketing and operations management;  be able to formulate an information-driven strategic response to marketing or operational circumstances.  Key Skills:   Creating a holistic vision.  Building and developing teams.  Negotiating and persuading.  Networking.  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence.

Aims  To provide students with the opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation at an advanced level of an issue which is applicable and relevant to business and/or management.   The positioning of the dissertation at the end of the programme is intended to promote integration of material covered in the core and elective phases.  The dissertation should be theoretically underpinned and should normally involve undertaking empirical research, but may be a critical essay that draws upon academic literature.  Content  Students can choose to pursue either of two types of dissertation: a business project in which they work with a host organisation;  an issue-led investigation which is not focused on just one organisation but instead examines a management issue by, for example, conducting and analysing a survey of  practice in a number of organisations.  The topic (which is formally approved by the Board of Examiners) should be one that is suitable for in-depth investigation.  MBA dissertations have typically been based in a wide variety of organisations, including: profit-seeking companies in both manufacturing and the service sector; nationalised industries; public agencies and local authorities; non-profit seeking organisations; global multinationals; and owner-managed small firms.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically analyse a specific issue or area of management or business in depth and to explore its significance in practice.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically apply knowledge and different forms of reasoning to form a discriminating analysis of issues currently being experienced in specific organisational and business contexts;  be able to conduct an independent piece of advanced research, over a longer period of time than has been possible on the programme hitherto, thereby further developing analytical and research skills needed to explore business and management problems in depth;  produce a substantial piece of written work demonstrating critical analysis of a specific issue.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  have further developed the skills of self-organization and motivation in managing time and activities in working to a deadline.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Individual meetings with the appointed supervisor, up to 8 but normally 5-6 during the dissertation period.

Corequisites  None.  Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  This module aims to cover key issues concerning the behaviour of individuals in organisations.  Content  Introduction to organisational behaviour.  Individual differences: personal and mental ability.  Management of attitudes and work motivation.  Leading others (e.g. ethical leadership).  Organisational culture (e.g. sustainability).  Managing group dynamics and teamwork.  Decision-making in organisations.  Addressing (in-)justice and (in-)equality within organisations.  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSiR).  An introduction to the management of change.  Proactive and intrapreneurial employee behaviours for organisational innovation and performance.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  Have a critical understanding of why employees display different attitudes and patterns of behaviour in the organisational environment.  Have a critical understanding of how individual-level processes (e.g. personality) and group-level processes (e.g. culture) interact to produce organisational level outcomes.  Have a critical understanding of the link of major processes, such as leadership, motivation and trust, with individual and organisational outcomes.  Have a critical understanding of the importance of ethics and intrapreneurial behaviours for wellbeing and performance in organisations.  Have a critical awareness of the fact that appropriate design must be accompanied by careful implementation for the success of a human resource system.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  Be able to use key organisational behaviour techniques (e.g. goal setting theory of motivation) to design human resource systems that improve individual (e.g. productivity, well-being) and unit (e.g. team cohesion) outcomes.  Be able to evaluate the merit of academic and professional publications from both a scientific and a practitionerâ€™s point of view.  Key Skills:   Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy  The ability to take responsibility for continuing to learn through reflection on practice and developing their own critical self-awareness, knowledge and skills Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy. Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The learning outcomes will be achieved through a combination of lectures, case studies, videos, individual exercises, group discussion  and guided reading.  The summative assessment will take the form of an in-depth essay analysing a detailed 'Organisational Behaviour' case study, using a range of theories encountered on the module.  This will require students to generate a set of credible and feasible change management interventions to address the issues in the case, thus demonstrating their understanding of key issues and techniques, and to reflect on their own approach to analysing the problem and generating a solution.  The case study will be selected by the module leader from an appropriate source (e.g. Harvard Business Review) on an Organisational Behaviour topic (e.g. 2015-16: salary disclosure in a company).    In the formative assignment students will outline their general approach to this case, such as the theoretical framework (e.g. organisational justice theory), for their subsequent case analysis in the summative assignment.

For students to analyse the data forms and processes underpinning at least one major organisation on a significant dimension of its â€˜organisational systemâ€™ (e.g. marketing, strategy, finance, innovation, HRM).  For students to research and produce either a single detailed case study or a comparative analysis of two organisations, based on desk research prior to the trip and primary research conducted during the tour.  To enhance the employability of students, through exposure to leading international companies.  To give students an insight into different working environments when they are considering in which sector to develop their careers.    Content  Pre-Trip preparation:  â€¢ In groups, students will thoroughly research a selected company in general terms, in terms of a strategic analysis, and on its dimension of focus (e.g. innovation, finance, HRM) to be confirmed prior to the tour.  â€¢ They will produce and present formative group presentations, based on their groupâ€™s desk-research (e.g. published case studies, as well as articles in leading periodicals and newspapers, such as the FT).  â€¢ They will submit a research plan to the organisers for how they will tackle the topic relevant to each organisationâ€™s needs.    Field Trip:  â€¢ The field trip will comprise visits to a series of data-intensive participating organisations in Silicon Valley, with time set aside for group work.  â€¢ During each visit, students will present their analysis to the representatives of the participating organisations.  There will be time for feedback and questions.    The post-Trip report delivery:  â€¢ After the field trip, individual students submit a summative assignment comprising their own final analysis, either of a single organisation or comparing and contrasting two organisations (2,500 words).  â€¢  The summative assignment will include a section (500 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, what they personally learned about their topic on the field trip, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge in their future career (i.e. â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ activity).    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students will be able to demonstrate a critical understanding of:  Methods for identifying and presenting a host organisationâ€™s essential dimensions (scale, history, structure, operations and markets, current performance)  Methods for identifying and analysing how the host organisations design and co-ordinate their operations or policies on a given management topic  Critical analysis of how this approach originated, and its impact on operational performance and employee well-being in the host organisations  Organisations as â€˜data systemsâ€™  Applied analysis of theory and frameworks at an advanced level inside a real organisation  The benefits and limitations of primary research, especially the production of detailed case studies    Subject-specific Skills:   Ability to identify evidence for the underlying assumptions and theoretical differences in different approaches to particular aspects of organisational systems.  Effective group work, including collaborative effort in the research, drafting, and presentation of a report, as well as interpersonal sensitivity, perhaps across national cultural boundaries.  Desk research and primary research associated with case studies  Ability to appreciate the concept of a â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ and to reflect critically on their own (future) practice as a way of learning and developing.

It also tests their capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights.  Because the majority of the learning activity takes place on the tour itself, there will be no formal lectures. Instead, it is planned that there will be three preparatory seminars during Term 2, which will prepare the students for the tour, get them to reflect on case study methodology in the preparation for their formative group presentations, and to agree upon a viable approach to the primary research to be undertaken on the tour itself.  On the tour itself, the participating organisations â€“ having been briefed and having agreed on the overall theme of their visit â€“ will submit to questioning and other forms of primary research. The groups will prepare questions, and assess the evidence for the organisationâ€™s responses to those questions. Free time during the tour will be used to consolidate knowledge, and/or to prepare for visits to the host organisations.  Parallel arrangements will be put in place for any student unable to travel to Silicon Valley, to ensure the module learning outcomes are still satisfied.  Specifically, they will still take part in the preparatory seminars and will also have access to specially recorded lectures, individual tutorial support and pre-prepared data sets.  For their summative assessment, the group presentation component will be replaced by an individual video presentation (i.e. the standard resit assessment). In their reflective practitioner statement they will be expected to draw on their experience of the preparatory seminars thus enabling the key skill of teamworking to be assessed.

To introduce students to different, and often contradictory theories on the sources and processes of building and maintaining competitive advantage.   To develop studentsâ€™ skills in analyzing complex business situations and synthesizing heterogeneous theoretical arguments into meaningful and testable hypotheses.  To develop studentsâ€™ proficiency in designing and conducting empirical research projects.  Content  This module covers fundamental perspectives on strategic management. It focuses on some foundational theories from Mintzberg (the question of whether strategy is emergent or planned), Porter (the cconcepts of competitive and sustainable advantage) and Barney (the â€œresource-based viewâ€) with an eye to understanding how these seminal contributions continue to reverberate in contemporary research on organizations worldwide.   Topics addressed include notably:   The concept of strategy.    Research on the evolution of firm capabilities.  Competitive dynamics.   Corporate strategies (i.e., mergers & acquisitions, diversification & divestiture, alliances).   Critical and organizationally inflected strategy theories such as strategy as practice.  A broad array of research methods, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative approaches as well as a plurality of paradigms.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Critical understanding of research gaps in current strategic management literature.   Critical understanding of theoriesâ€™ boundary conditions - for instance context-sensitive appreciation of the variety of circumstances and contingencies, as well as kinds of organizations to which the theory may apply.  Critical understanding of research methods and their relevance to global management practice.  Critical understanding of the micro-practices that influence how strategy is enacted in daily work - this will be addressed in relation to research methods by incorporating aspects of ethnography (understood broadly as a methodological stance) and observation (as a method).  Subject-specific Skills:   Ability to critically evaluate theories and research on global strategic management    Richer appreciation of the case method  Appreciation of the relevance of institutional theory to strategy   Ability to develop relevant research questions, assess different research designs, choose suitable measurement methodologies, select appropriate samples and analyze data using statistical tools and software.    Key Skills:   Written communication skills  The development of cohesive and persuasive arguments   Developing well-motivated, interesting and relevant research questions suitable to explanatory, exploratory and rich, inferential description (for instance grounded theory or case study designs)  Logically building up (explanatory) hypotheses and propositions, or devising (exploratory) novel research questions, or identifying (rich, inferential description) well-framed settings and problems  Designing robust and coherent research that, where appropriate, draws from one or more epistemological stances and traditions  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The module involves workshops that highlight the main issues, strengths, weaknesses, controversies, and gaps in the readings for each session.   Workshops take the form of intensive and guided small group discussion of research questions in relation to theory and methods.  Learning will occur primarily through critical assessment of ideas, concepts, theories and methods discussed in the class, supported by guided reading (including academic papers, book chapters and videos) which will be available online.  Summative assessment is by means of an enquiry-based essay. (The essay will involve the critical analysis and application of a particular aspect of the strategic management literature. The essay is chosen from a list of contemporary strategic management-related debates.).  The formative assessment comprises an outline plan of the summative essay, on which feedback is provided.

To allow students to reflect upon and improve the analytical, professional and social skills expected of an MBA graduate.   To develop insights into the multi-disciplinary nature of corporate management of an organisation.   To enable students to understand at an advanced level the implications of and trends within corporate governance structures, frameworks and policy for the effective management of corporations.  To develop and enhance skills in communication, presentation, persuasion and mindfulness within the context of the boardroom of an international organisation.  Content  During the initial stage of the MBA Programme, students will be introduced to the necessary functional disciplines of general management through a range of core modules. This module allows the student to explore the multi-disciplinary nature of general management by seeing the application of all these functional disciplines within the setting of the corporate boardroom.  The module is centred on the Boardroom Exercise, which is a small-group activity towards the end of the core period of the programme MBA programme. Students are allocated to groups and simulate the behaviour of the executive management team of a specified real-world organisation as they prepare for and participate in a simulation of a board meeting of the corporation. This meeting is chaired by an external executive with extensive board experience along with other similar external executives and academic staff who undertake the role of non-executive directors. The activity is designed to provide an opportunity for experiential learning, with the group carefully searching for and analysing relevant information; preparing an agreed agenda and board papers for the meeting; participating as specified members of the executive management team within the meeting and presenting and facing questions upon the papers from the non-executive directors as part of the board’s deliberations and decision-making processes.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of this module, students should:  Have a critical appreciation of corporate governance structures, risk management procedures, and related processes and policy development as they apply to the activities of a corporate board; the roles and responsibilities of executive and non-executive directors; and the effective performance of company boards;  Have an advanced understanding of how the disciplines of general management can be integrated and used to effectively manage the strategic development and performance of an international company;   Have an advanced understanding of the typical challenges faced by international business organisations and the development of options available to address them within the context of ethical business practices and environmental sustainability.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  Be able to think strategically and critically about the performance of an international corporation, as well as functionally;  Be able to critically analyse the internal, market and non-market environments of the corporation in order to understand the strategic constraints and opportunities it faces to address current and future performance;   Be able to develop, as part of a team, detailed and integrated management reports that explain current corporate performance and/or define management actions to address performance and contribute to the future strategic development of the corporation;   Be able to articulate and persuade groups like non-executive directors and the broader investment community that the executive management team has a clear understanding of current corporate performance and the ability to drive successful future performance;  Be able to think self-critically about their managerial knowledge and professional skills, identifying gaps and opportunities for continued personal development.  Key Skills:   Building and developing teams  Negotiating and persuading  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence  Interpreting and using numerical and financial information   Reflecting and synthesising from experience  Developing critical thinking and reflection   Synthesising diverse perspectives  Developing coherent and persuasive arguments  Selecting appropriate modes of communication       Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Whilst not part of the teaching input into this module, students will be expected to draw on the content and skills developed in other core modules.  Taught components will examine issues of corporate governance structures and processes; the roles and responsibilities of directors and boards; the composition of effective boards; the nature of board papers and investor communications. This will also include drawing upon the collective experience and expertise of the senior executives acting as board chairs and other NEDs. Some of this material may be made available in online format rather than in a classroom session.  A workshop on effective boardroom behaviour will examine and develop thinking, listening and communicating skills, drawing on the latest thinking on effective leadership approaches including mindfulness. Appropriate links will be drawn to the wider programme of professional and personal skills and development. The workshop will be followed by group-based coaching in both effective board behaviours and upon the content of the board papers and board meeting. In addition, where timing permits, the groups will have the opportunity to draw on the skills/mentoring of their board chairs and other non-executive directors though informal meetings and web/telephone communication. This includes the Chairs and non-executive directors leading the feedback session, immediately after the full board meeting.  The boardroom groups will need to spend considerable time, both together and individually, analysing the chosen company, evaluating its performance and strategy, devising and evaluating strategic responses and preparing the relevant documents (board papers) for consideration. This will include seeking guidance from both their chairs/NEDs and the module team on the content and presentation of the papers required for the meeting.  As this team-based exercise seeks to replicate the collaborative nature of boardroom decision making the module is assessed by two group elements: the team performance within the board meeting (60%), and the team performance in preparing the board papers (40%).  As the Boardroom meeting would be difficult to repeat, any student failing the group component of assessment will have a resit opportunity consisting of a 3,000 word individual report focusing upon the performance and proposed strategies of the chosen corporation, provided that they had engaged meaningfully with the exercise. Those unable to participate fully in the preparations for and/or the board meeting at the end of the exercise will be required to take the module again (at the same attempt) on a later occasion, normally with the next cohort.

Each student will submit an individual learning journal (2,000 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, how studying the international frameworks and the business culture of the country they visited helped them during the tour, what they personally learnt on the tour, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge (i.e. the 'reflective practitioner' activity). The  debriefing session will help students with this task.  Students will also submit an international business case analysis.    Subject Content:  Introduction to International Business in Context  Cultural environment on international business  Ethics in international business  Theories of international trade and investment   Political and legal systems in national environment  Global market opportunity assessment  Entering and operating in international markets   Marketing in the global firm  Human resource management and financial management in the global firm    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should have a critical understanding of:  How businesses operate in an overseas context.    How to use the existing strategic models to make decisions in companies operating in the international context.   Environmental forces that shape companies' decisions in international markets.   Effects of their strategic decisions on the company performance.  How to develop capabilities for strategic combination of resources in companies and its influence on international performance.   How international business frameworks can be used to analyse real organisationsâ€™ options in international contexts.    Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should have:  Acquired the skills to put organisational theory into practice.  Developed skills in desk research and primary research associated with the production of business plans and analysis of business case studies/simulations.  The ability to appreciate the concept of a â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ and to reflect critically on organisations, as a way of learning and developing.     Key Skills:   Effective written communication skills   Planning, organising and time-management skills  Problem solving and analysis  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module comprises a mix of online delivery, webinars and international study tour. All students will be expected to engage in class discussion and debate in order to facilitate the formation of their critical judgments.    The summative assessment consists of two individual assignments: an international business case analysis of 1000 words, and a reflective learning journal of 2000 words.  For the international business case analysis, students will be required to make decisions in an international context regarding entry strategies, market analysis, product, pricing, distribution and communication in relation to the global company they analyse, allowing students to learn from their own experience, and put into practice the concepts they have discussed during the module.   The individual learning journal, based around the company visits and accompanying strategic analysis exercise, will test studentsâ€™ capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights.

To allow students to reflect upon and improve the analytical, professional and social skills expected of an MBA graduate.  To develop insights into the multi-disciplinary nature of corporate management of an organisation.  To enable students to understand at an advanced level the implications of and trends within corporate governance structures, frameworks and policy for the effective management of corporations.  To develop and enhance skills in communication, presentation, persuasion and mindfulness within the context of the boardroom of an international organisation.  To develop links with the Business School's research strategy by incorporating current research in strategic management, leadership, and financial management.  Content  During the initial stage of the MBA Programme, students are introduced to the necessary functional disciplines of general management through a range of thematic core modules. This module allows the student to explore the multi-disciplinary nature of general management at a corporate level by seeing the application of all these functional disciplines within the setting of the corporate boardroom.    The module is centred on the Boardroom Exercise which is a small-group activity that runs within the pathway stage of the MBA programme. Students are allocated to groups and simulate the behaviour of the executive management team of a specified real-world organisation as they prepare for and participate in a simulation of a board meeting of the corporation. This meeting is chaired by an external executive with extensive board experience along with other similar external executives and academic staff who undertake the role of non-executive directors. The activity is designed to provide an opportunity for experiential learning, with the group carefully searching for and analysing relevant information; preparing an agreed agenda and board papers for the meeting; participating as specified members of the executive management team within the meeting and, finally, preparing, presenting and facing questions upon the subsequent investorsâ€™ briefing.   Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:   Have a critical appreciation of corporate governance structures, risk management procedures, and related processes and policy development as they apply to the activities of a corporate board; the roles and responsibilities of executive and non-executive directors; and the effective performance of company boards;  Have an advanced understanding of how the disciplines of general management can be integrated and used to effectively manage the strategic development and performance of an international company;  Have an advanced understanding of the typical challenges faced by international business organisations and the development of options available to address them within the context of ethical business practices and environmental sustainability.    Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  Be able to think strategically and critically about the performance of an international corporation, as well as functionally;  Be able to critically analyse the internal, market and non-market environments of the corporation in order to understand the strategic constraints and opportunities it faces to address current and future performance;  Be able to develop, as part of a team, detailed and integrated management reports that explain current corporate performance and/or define management actions to address performance and contribute to the future strategic development of the corporation;   Be able to articulate and persuade groups like non-executive directors and the broader investment community that the executive management team has a clear understanding of current corporate performance and the ability to drive successful future performance;  Be able to think self-critically about their managerial knowledge and professional skills, identifying gaps and opportunities for continued personal development.    Key Skills:   Building and developing teams   Negotiating and persuading   Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence   Interpreting and using numerical and financial information   Reflecting and synthesising from experience  Developing critical thinking and reflection   Synthesising diverse perspectives   Developing coherent and persuasive arguments   Selecting appropriate modes of communication    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Whilst not part of the teaching input into this module, students will be expected to draw on the content and skills developed in other core modules.   Lectures/presentations will examine issues of corporate governance structures & processes; the roles and responsibilities of directors and boards; the composition of effective boards; the nature of board papers and investor communications. This will also include drawing upon the collective experience and expertise of the senior executives acting as board chairs and other NEDs. Some of this material may be made available in online format rather than in a classroom session.  A workshop on effective boardroom behaviour will examine and develop thinking, listening and communicating skills, drawing on the latest thinking on effective leadership approaches including mindfulness. Appropriate links will be drawn to the wider programme of professional and personal skills and development. The workshop will be followed by group-based coaching in both effective board behaviours and upon the content of the board papers and board meeting. In addition, where timing permits, the groups will have the opportunity to draw on the skills/mentoring of their board chairs and other non-executive directors though informal meetings and web/telephone communication. This includes the Chairs and non-executive directors leading the feedback session, immediately after the full board meeting.  The boardroom groups will need to spend considerable time, both together and individually, analyzing the chosen company, evaluating its performance and strategy, devising and evaluating strategic responses and preparing the relevant documents (board papers) for consideration.  This will include seeking guidance from both their chairs/NEDs and the module team on the content and presentation of the papers required for the meeting. Group meetings with the Chair/NEDs will consist of an initial meeting plus periodic face-to-face/Skype meetings, telephone calls and emails.  As this team-based exercise seeks to replicate the collaborative nature of boardroom decision making the module is assessed by two group elements: the team performance within the board meeting (60%), and the team performance in preparing the board papers (40%).   As the Boardroom meeting would be difficult to repeat, any student failing the group  component of assessment will have a resit opportunity consisting of a 3,000 word individual report focusing upon a review of the performance and proposed strategies of the chosen corporation, provided that they had engaged meaningfully with the exercise. Those unable to participate fully in the preparations for and/or the board meeting at the end of the exercise will be required to take the resit assessment.

To visit leading international companies and to understand and evaluate the complex nature of different dimensions of their business in one overseas country.  To recognise and value the role of national culture and language in the way business operates, and to be able to function in context in a second business language.  To provide a sound platform for foreign language acquistion by helping students to understand the core structure of the language through the study of grammar and vocabulary.  To compare and contrast organisations on a specific dimension (e.g. strategy, finance, operations, HRM).  To develop students' research skills through the production of a detailed case study of leading international organisations, based on desk research prior to the tour and primary research conducted during the tour.  Content  The module delivery is divided into five parts:   1) Discussion of international business theoretical frameworks.  During the sessions students will discuss the most relevant international business frameworks.  These will allow them to understand how internationalised companies operate in international contexts.  The frameworks will also allow students to understand the companies that they will visit on their international study tour.  2) The pre-tour preparation inclduing language classes. Students will study their chosen language to an appropriate level (i.e. Mandarin Chinese, German, or Spanish) and the culture of the country they will visit through weekly classes prior to their visit.  3) A week-long international study tour to either China, Germany or Spain (previous tours have been based in Beijing, Mannheim and Barcelona).  This will include visits to a range of organisations.  4) Post-tour debriefing.  The module leader will conduct a post-tour debrief session to analyse the experience the students had.  Each student will submit an individual learning journal (3,000 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, how studying the international frameworks, the language and the national culture of the country they visited helped them during the tour, what they personally learnt on the tour, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge (i.e. the 'reflective practitioner' activity).  An online debriefing session for all students will be arranged to help them with this task.  5) During the module students will also engage, in groups, in a summatively assessed international management simulation.  Subject Content:  Introduction to International Business in Context  Cultural environment on international business  Ethics in international business  Theories of international trade and investment  Political and legal systems in national environment  Global market opportunity assessment  Entering and operating in international markets  Marketing in the global firm  Human resource management and financial management in the global firm  Foreign language - studetns are required to study one of several foreign languages that will be offered.

How to use the existing strategic models to make decisions in companies operating in the international context.  Environmental forces that shape companies' decisions in international markets.  Effects of their strategic decisions on the company performance.  How to develop capabilities for strategic combination of resources in companies and its influence on international performance.  How international business frameworks can be used to analyse real organisations options in international contexts.  How the language and culture influence how businesses operate.  Students should also have an understanding of basic grammar and an appropriate level of vocabulary in a chosen foreign language they have not studied previously, sufficient for tasks requiring a direct exchange of information on familiar topics and activities.     Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should have:   Acquired the skills to put organisational theory into practice.  Effective group work skills, including collaborative effort in the research, drafting, refinement, and presentation of an assignment, as well as interpersonal sensitivity, which may be across national and/or cultural boundaries.

An understanding of the chosen language that will allow simple, everyday conversations and texts.     Key Skills:   Written communication  Planning, organising and time management  Problem solving and analysis  Interpretation of data and computer literacy  Team working  Interpersonal skills  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module is taught in blocks, comprising a mix of lecture-style delivery, class debate and guest speakers, and includes an international business simulation and international study tour. All students will be expected to engage in class discussion and debate in order to facilitate the formation of their critical judgments.   For the international management simulation, students will work in  groups of 5 to 6 within the taught blocks. They will be required to make decisions in an international context regarding entry strategies, market analysis, product, pricing, distribution and communication in relation to the virtual global company they manage. The simulation will be undertaken using a web-based software managed by the module leader. Simulations bring realism and critical thinking into the classroom, allowing students to learn from their own experience, experiment with different management strategies, and  put into practice the concepts they have discussed during the module.    An introduction to the language and culture of the country students will be visiting will be provided through weekly 2-hour language classes.  The summative group simulation exercise is designed to test the studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding of the subject, and their ability to apply this to organisations. All students will receive the same mark. The individual learning journal will, in addition, test their capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights, and the two language assessments will test their language capability.

Key Skills:   The ability to communicate effectively: communicating complex ideas orally and in writing;     The ability to think critically and creatively and to argue coherently.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The module will be delivered in a series of workshops. Each of the workshops will typically involve a mixture of lecture input, groupwork and feedback. Workshops will be used to deliver core knowledge and explain theories and models; it is also expected that external speakers will deliver guest lectures and contribute to a subsequent discussion in more than one of the workshops. Groupwork will involve activities such as the discussion of a paper or a case study set in advance with students preparing material to feed back during a plenary session. The material covered in workshops and groupwork will include a global perspective on the issues that sustainability gives rise to and, while being focused on business organisations, will not be exclusively so. Outside of class time students will be expected to read widely and prepare for the following class.       Formative assessment will consist of writing up answers to one of the case studies.      Summative assessment will consist of an individual assignment based on an organisation of the studentâ€™s choice (but not one of the case study companies considered in class, and agreed in advance with the Module Leader) in which the various aspects of the module are applied to consider what the organisation would have to do to move to be sustainable in the medium to long term.  The resit opportunity will also be an individual assignment but based on a different organisation to the original submission.

To provide students with the opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation at an advanced level of an issue which is applicable and relevant to their degree subject.  The positioning of the dissertation at the end of the programme is intended to promote integration of material covered in the core and optional modules.  To equip students with an in-depth understanding of key principles of research design and methodology in business and management and philosophy, and to develop their skills in conducting and disseminating research at an advanced level.  To provide students with an introduction to a variety of research methods in the social sciences, including both quantitative and qualitative methods.  To enable students to use a range of perspectives to critically review research studies in terms of theorising, methods and findings.

Content  Introduction: approaches to social research;  Formulating a research question;  Conducting a literature review;  Developing a research strategy that fits your question;  The nature of qualitative research;  The nature of quantitative research;  An overview of data gathering methods (including interviews and focus groups, and archive document collection; survey and experiment designs; panel data; questionnaires and experiments);  The analysis of quantitative and qualitative data (including panel data, interview transcripts and document analysis);  Ethics of research;  Planning and managing a research project;  Ethical Theories and Applied Ethics;  Philosophical Argumentation in Business Ethics;  Moral Values and Compiance with Professional Codes of Ethics.  The dissertation topic is chosen by the student and formally approved by the Programme Director on behalf of the Chair of the Board of Examiners. It should be one that is suitable for in-depth investigation, and relevant to business ethics in management.    Students may choose to undertake a Business Project in place of the traditional dissertation format. This may be achieved by either working with a specific host organisation or, alternatively, by undertaking an issue-led investigation across a range of organisations on a specific management issue. The topic must be suitable for in-depth investigation, however, and formally approved by the Programme Director on behalf of the Chair of the Board of Examiners.     The Business Project route is theoretically underpinned in the same way as a traditional dissertation, and should normally involve undertaking empirical research, but may be a critical essay that draws upon academic literature.  The project requires students to write a short literature review, followed by a detailed explanation of their selected research method, including â€“ where relevant â€“ detail on data collection and analytical methods, the presentation of their findings, and a short discussion of the results, including recommendations for the host organisation.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:-    Have a critical appreciation of the range of philosophical approaches to research in business and management;    Be aware of, and familiar with, the facilities available for conducting literature searches and obtaining relevant data to facilitate empirical investigation;    Be aware of relevant computer packages for conducting empirical analysis;     Have a critical understanding of a relevant topic and the most appropriate techniques of research and analysis;    Have a critical understanding of methodological issues in research: issues in designing and undertaking quantitative and qualitative research;    Have a critical understanding of the principles of research design proposals;  Have a critical awareness of techniques for philosophical argumentation on Business Ethics.    Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:    Be able to organise, structure and manage a research project in management (business ethics) effectively, and conduct empirical/theoretical analysis at an advanced level;   Be able to make a critical evaluation of published journal articles and assess their relevance to a chosen research project;    Be able to operate independently on a research topic and exercise appropriate judgement in the selection of material;    Have further developed the skills of inquiry, bibliographic search, data collection, measurement and analysis, interpretation and presentation of results.    Key Skills:   Planning, organising and using initiative;  Computer literacy;  Numeracy;  Written communication of research on a chosen topic;  Time management;    Self-discipline;  Problem solving and analysis;  Written communication of research on a chosen topic to a relevant audience(s)     Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  A combination of lectures, seminars, computer labs and guided reading addressing key topics in research will cover the subject-specific knowledge and skills together with general aspects of the dissertation process.    The combined summative components of the dissertation require students to write a draft research proposal, including a short literature review, and a detailed initial plan for a research method, including - where relevant - detail on data collection and likely analytical methods. Students then work independently on their research, analysis and writing up, for their dissertation, under the guidance of a supervisor, modifying their research design if necessary. Within the dissertation, students produce a short executive summary providing a business perspective on their research findings.   Normally the student will meet their supervisor on no more than six occasions. This is considered appropriate, given that the dissertation module is underpinned by lectures and seminars/computer labs.

Content  Introduction: approaches to social research  Formulating a research question  Conducting a literature review  Developing a research strategy that fits your question  The nature of qualtitative research  The nature of quantitative research  An overview of data gathering methods (including interviews, questionnaires and experiments, focus groups, surveys and experiment designs, and panel data)  The analysis of quantitative and qualitative data (including, respectively, t-tests, correlations and regressions, as well as panel data, interview transcripts, and document analysis)  Ethics of research  Planning and managing a research project.  The dissertation topic is chosen by the student and formally approved by the Programme Director on behalf of the Chair of the Board of Examiners. For MSc Management (Finance) students, the topic should be in the broad area of financial management. It can be on finance itself, or on the management of finance, including the managerial consequences of financial decisions, or how to manage finance employees, etc. There is no requirement to engage in financial or statistical or quantitative methods.  Students may choose to undertake a Business Project in place of the traditional dissertation format.  This may be achieved by either working with a specific host organisation or, alternatively, by undertaking an issue-led investigation across a range of organisations on a specific management issue.  The topic must be suitable for in-depth investigation, however, and formally approved by the Programme Director on behalf of the Chair of the Board of Examiners.  The Business Project is theoretically underpinned in the same way as a traditional dissertation, and should normally involve undertaking empirical research, but may be a critical essay that draws upon academic literature.  The project requires students to write a short literature review, followed by a detailed explanation of their selected research method, including - where relevant - detail on data collection and analytical methods, the presentation of their findings, and a short discussion of the results, including recommendations for the host organisation.  In producing the dissertation, students will make use of and manage library facilities, databases and other learning resources.  Before going abroad, students attend information briefings on undertaking their dissertation abroad and are assisted with the application process by the MSc Study Abroad team. In addition, students are monitored and supported by the MSc Study Abroad team while abroad, and have a mentor from the partner institution.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  Have a critical understanding and awareness of the nature and scope of advanced research in management.

Content  Students select a topic for their dissertation that fits within the remit of their subject area.  This is to be approved by the studentâ€™s supervisory team in the first instance and subsequently ratified by the Director of the PhD Programme. They are advised that the dissertation should analyse a relevant issue in some depth, demonstrating a critical understanding of relevant theory, empirical research and practice; and that the investigation must enable them to draw on and utilise knowledge and skills gained in the preceding modules.  It is appropriate for the Dissertation to be seen as something to feed into the research phase of the PhD with Integrated Studies programme and therefore it may take the form of an advanced purposeful literature analysis (e.g., a meta-analysis) and theorisation or theoretical positioning, a scoping enquiry, a preliminary investigation, etc.  All proposed topics must be formally approved by the supervisory team and Programme Director as outlined above.    Students will normally have 6 formal supervision meetings during the period of the Dissertation module.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Have developed advanced critical understanding of a relevant topic through a review of the literature, identification of research questions and the utilisation of appropriate techniques of analysis.

It aims to re-dress the common imbalance of typical marketing programmes, which tend to over-emphasise the importance of business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing. The module provides a comprehensive and critical introduction to the main theoretical and managerial issues in the area of B2B marketing.

Aims  Customer Relationship Management (CRM) means active work to handle customer relationships on a large scale with long-term profitability and survival in mind (Gummeson 2002). To succeed an organisation must:  identify individual customers and establish how they can be reached;  differentiate customers by their values and needs;  interact with customers - establish a dialogue;  customise - treat every customer as an individual through personal contact or an automated process;  make the relationship a continuously learning relationship.  CRM is seen as a critical strategic issue by many public, not for profit and commercial organisations.  To introduce a framework for CRM that provides a critical insight into the strategic contribution of CRM and the organisational competencies required.  To provide participants with the opportunity to develop advanced knowledge and experience of specific practices that contribute to important CRM competencies.  To introduce participants to the contribution of Information Systems (IS) in succeeding with CRM and provide a foundation of knowledge for understanding how to exploit IT to create value from CRM.  The module takes a multidisciplinary approach bringing together insights from Marketing and IS perspectives.  Content  Introduction to CRM.  Definitions of CRM.  The importance of CRM in different industry sectors and scenarios (for example retail, services, not for profit, public sector).  History of CRM and causes of failure.  The relationships involved in CRM.  CRM competences.  Customer Valuation.  Contact Management.  Customer Base Segmentation.  Campaign Management.  Personalisation of Service.  Response Management.  Retention Management.  Attrition Management.  Ethical and legal issues.  The contribution of IS to CRM - an architectural perspective.  Building the organisational capability to succeed with CRM.  Success factors.  Performance management.  Organisational change to develop the required competences.  Future trends affecting CRM (including IS).  The elective will build on core material from MICE and Managing Information.  The module will balance providing a strategic perspective on CRM and focusing on specific key topics to enable participants to build their ability to make a real contribution to the success of CRM in their future organisations.  It is our intention to make significant use of case studies and in particular to use hands-on IS case studies closely related to key practices for CRM. On this basis attendance at the elective would be restricted to 25 people to allow the group to make effective use of the IS facilities.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will be able to:  critically analyse the potential contribution of CRM to organisational performance;  explain the nature of customer information and the complex range of relationships between supplier, customer and other stakeholders involved in CRM;  recognise the complex issues involved in assessing organisational readiness for CRM;  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will be able to:  use a range of specified practices that underpin organisational competencies for CRM;  debate the case for CRM as a long term organisational change programme and not a technology quick win and have a critical appreciation of major success/failure factors for CRM initiatives;  debate future trends in CRM including the impact of IS;  design a high level, benefit driven strategy for a CRM programme.

To introduce a framework for CRM that provides a critical insight into the strategic contribution of CRM and the organisational competencies required.  To provide participants with the opportunity to develop advanced knowledge and experience of specific practices that contribute to important CRM competencies.

It is no longer based primarily on conceptual content, relying on mental models, deep insights and years of experience to formulate marketing decisions, the New Marketing instead resembles design engineering - it consists of putting together data, models, analysis, and computer simulations in order to learn about the marketplace and to design effective strategic marketing plans.  To provide a comprehensive introduction to Quantitative Marketing Research (or ""Marketing Engineering""); the application of mathematical decision models in the formulation of marketing management decisions.  Specifically, the module demonstrates how mathematical models and statistical techniques can be used to transform objective and subjective data about the marketing environment into informed management decisions and decision implementations.  Based around both Microsoft Excel and the SPSS statistical package, the module explores both the conceptual knowledge underpinning quantitative marketing decision models and the practical skills needed to generate those models and computer simulations.  Participants MUST therefore be confident in both their own statistical abilities and IT skills and have a good working knowledge of Microsoft Excel.  Content  The Marketing Research Process.

To compare and contrast organisations on a specific aspect (e.g. culture, strategy, finance, HRM).    To research and produce a detailed case study of leading international organizations, based on desk research prior to the tour and primary research conducted during the tour.     To provide an insight into international business in context.    Content  Module content is divided into three major parts: the pre-tour preparation of a formative research report into two of the organizations which the students will visit; the tour itself; and the post-tour completion of the research report, plus an individual reflective assignment.       Pre-Tour preparation: There will be 3 preparatory webinars for the students prior to the tour.  In groups of 3-4, students will research their chosen dimension (eg culture, HRM, finance) to examine in the two organizations which they will compare and contrast.  They will produce a 1,500-word formative assignment based on their groupâ€™s desk-research (e.g. printed case studies, as well as journals and newspapers) one month before the tour, to be marked by faculty prior to the visit.   A week before the tour, they will submit a research plan for how they will gather primary data when visiting the company.       The Tour:  The tour will involve visits to each of the participating organizations, spread across five days.  The post-tour assignment:   Following the tour, the group will submit a shared summative assignment comprising their final report comparing and contrasting both organizations (1,000 words).   Each student will also submit a further individual assignment (3,000 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, what they personally learned on the tour, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge (i.e. â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ activity).   There will be an online de-briefing session for all students.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students should have a critical understanding of:     How businesses operate in an overseas context.    The similarities and differences among leading international companies in aspects of their organisation    How these similarities and differences manifest themselves, how they originated, and their impact on performance.    Applied analysis of theory and frameworks in a real organization.     The benefits and limitations of primary research, especially the production of detailed case studies.    Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should have:    The ability to put the organisational theory into practice.    Acquired effective group work skills, including collaborative effort in the research, drafting, refinement, and presentation of an assignment, as well as interpersonal sensitivity, perhaps across national cultural boundaries.    Acquired skills in desk research and primary research associated with the production of case studies. The ability to appreciate the concept of a â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ and to reflect critically on organizations, as a way of learning and developing.    Key Skills:   Written communication;     Planning, organising and time management;     Problem solving and analysis;     Interpretation of data; computer literacy,      Team working     Interpersonal skills.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The summative written assignments are designed to test the studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding of their chosen topic, and their ability to apply this to organisations. They also test their capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights.       There will be three online webinars (seminars), which will prepare the students for the visit, get them to reflect on case study methodology in the preparation of their formative assignment, and a final webinar to examine the formative feedback, and to agree upon a viable approach to the primary research to be undertaken on the tour itself.       On the tour itself, the participating organisations â€“ having been briefed and having agreed on the overall theme of their visit â€“ will submit to questioning and other forms of primary research. The groups will prepare questions, and assess the evidence for the organisationâ€™s responses to those questions.       The post-tour webinar will be an opportunity to reflect on learning and de-brief on the visit.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The module provides students with the opportunity to engage as a group with a research project outside their usual workplace in an international development context. The project provides students with an opportunity to put their learning into practice and then enhance their learning by reflecting on their experience.    The main modes of learning are from the on-the-ground work associated with the particular project that is undertaken, and from the associated academic material on development and social enterprise.    The teaching input will take two forms. Initially there will be some relatively didactic input introducing students to the theoretical underpinnings of development and social enterprise. It will then move to a more supportive role as students begin to work on their project, providing practical advice and reinforcing the theoretical input in relation to the particular project(s). There may also be some further didactic input dependent upon the specific nature of the project(s). The final element of teaching will take place after the project work has been completed and will largely consist in providing feedback on an initial draft of the project report together with input on how to produce a critical and reflective individual report.    The assessment consists of a group report on the project work (75%) and an individual reflective report on the learning that the team members each gained from the project itself (25%). These reports will enable reflection on the project as a whole including: the linkage between theory and practice; the process and outcome of the project; the effectiveness of the team; and the lessons learned.    In addition to participation in scheduled sessions, this module requires participation in a group field-work project in an international development setting. Students are expected to undertake preparation for this and for completion of post-project work summative assignments as well as to engage in independent reading and learning.

Payout Policy: dividend versus share buybacks; the dividend controversy; the signalling effects of dividends; the long-term trend of dividend payouts and firm characteristics.  Company Valuation: book value; market value and cash flow forecasts; factors affecting valuation; valuing for acquisitions; internal valuation.  Funding Gaps and the Issue of Smaller Firms: private equity; venture capital and the role of venture capitalists; relative merits of alternative sources of funding.  Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructuring: sources of acquisition synergies; structuring acquisitions; financing acquisitions; shareholders wealth effects; LBOs, MBOs and other forms of restructuring.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will have:  critical understanding of how lessons learned from the financial markets can be applied to the world of corporate financial management and strategy;  advanced knowledge and critical understanding of how managers make financial decisions in a world of uncertainty and imperfect information;  critical understanding of how the structure of organisations can influence corporate decision-making and performance;  critical knowledge of the main methods of company valuation, their merits and disadvantages;  critical understanding of the determinants of capital structure and payout policy, including non-financial stakeholders' interests, the costs of financial distress, and the informational content of gearing and dividends;  critical understanding of the role of takeovers as a tool for corporate control;  critical understanding of the financing issues associated with smaller firms.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will have:  demonstrated ability to learn to work independently in finance, exercising critical judgement and discrimination in the resolution of complex problematic situations;  had the opportunity to apply their problem solving and analytical skills to issues in finance in a complex specialised context.

Specifically, the module is divided into two distinct study blocks.    Block One is delivered online across a three-month period, divided up into study weeks with specially produced resources within each week. Resources vary according to the learning outcomes of a study week, but normally include: an introductory video, specially-prepared lectures, web-mediated small-group seminars (â€œwebinarsâ€), directed reading, reflection through e-learning activities, and opportunities for self-assessment and peer-to-peer learning within a tutor-facilitated discussion board. Tutors provide written, group feedback on formative work and facilitate discussion board communication as well as being available for individual consultation as necessary (usually by email or video-conferencing). This is identical to the Schoolâ€™s wholly-online distance learning modules and constitutes 50% of the module. Block One ends with a formative assignment, written feedback being provided at the start of Block Two as a platform for classroom-based learning activities.    Normally scheduled for delivery early in the following term to allow successful completion of, and feedback on, all formative elements, Block Two of the module is delivered in the classroom on a block-taught basis. The mode and format of teaching and learning is identical to the Schoolâ€™s part-time MA taught modules, the study time again being equivalent to 50% of a wholly-taught module. During this taught input, learning outcomes are met through a combination of traditional lectures, groupwork, experiential learning activities, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading and specially-produced audio-visual materials.

This module allows the student to explore the multi-disciplinary nature of general management by seeing the application of all these functional disciplines within the setting of the corporate boardroom.  The module is centred on the Boardroom Exercise which is a small-group activity (typically 5 â€“ 8 students per group) that runs within the second stage of the MBA programme.  Students are allocated to groups and simulate the behaviour of the executive management team of a specified real-world organisation as they prepare for and participate in a simulation of a board meeting of the corporation. This meeting is chaired by an external executive with extensive board experience along with other similar external executives and academic staff who undertake the role of non-executive directors.    The activity is designed to provide an opportunity for experiential learning, with the group carefully searching for and analysing relevant information; preparing an agreed agenda and board papers for the meeting; participating as specified members of the executive management team within the meeting including preparing, presenting and facing questions from the non-executive directors.  In addition to the group-based activities outlined above, each student will write an individual report that reflects upon their learning from the core modules and skills development programme as it applies to the boardroom exercise and their broader professional development.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  Have a critical appreciation of corporate governance structures, processes and policy development as they apply to the activities of a corporate board; the roles and responsibilities of executive and non executive directors; and the effective performance of company boards;  Have an advanced understanding of how the disciplines of general management can be integrated and used to effectively manage the strategic development and performance of an international company;  Have an advanced understanding of the typical challenges faced by international business organisations and the development of options available to address them.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  Be able to think strategically and critically about the performance of an international corporation, as well as functionally;  Be able to critically analyse the internal, market and non-market environments of the corporation in order to understand the strategic constraints and opportunities it faces to address current and future performance;  Be able to develop, as part of a team, detailed and integrated management reports that explain current corporate performance and/or define management actions to address performance and contribute to the future strategic development of the corporation;  Be able to articulate and persuade groups like non executive directors and the broader investment community that the executive management team has a clear understanding of current corporate performance and the ability to drive successful future performance;  Be able to think self-critically about their managerial knowledge and professional skills, identifying gaps and opportunities for continued personal development.  Key Skills:   Building and developing teams  Negotiating and persuading  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence  Interpreting and using numerical and financial information  Reflecting and synthesising from experience  Developing critical thinking  Synthesising diverse perspectives  Developing coherent and persuasive arguments  Selecting appropriate modes of communication  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Whilst not part of the teaching input into this module, students will be expected to draw on the content and skills developed in core modules.  A series of lectures/presentations will examine issues of corporate governance structures & processes; the roles and responsibilities of directors and boards; the composition of effective boards; the nature of board papers and investor communications.  This will also include a panel-based discussion drawing on the collective experience and expertise of the senior executives acting as board chairmen.  A workshop on effective boardroom behaviour will examine and develop thinking, listening and communicating skills, drawing on the latest thinking on effective leadership approaches.  Appropriate links will be drawn to the wider programme of professional and personal skills and development.  The workshop will be followed by group-based coaching in both effective board behaviours and upon the content of the board papers, board meeting and investor briefing.  There will also be a pre-board meeting (effectively a rehearsal of the full board meeting) led by the module teaching team â€“ which will simulate the meeting and provide verbal feedback to the group.  In addition, the groups will have the opportunity to draw on the skills/mentoring of their board chairman though informal meetings and web/telephone communication throughout the Boardroom Exercise.  This includes the Chairman leading the feedback session, alongside the other non-executive directors, immediately after the full board meeting.  The boardroom groups will need to spend considerable time, both together and individually, analyzing the chosen company, evaluating its performance and strategy, devising and evaluating strategic responses and preparing the relevant documents (board papers) for consideration.  Typically, the groups will need to meet as a management team on a regular basis, providing executive management committee minutes to the board chairman and seeking approval/guidance in the development of the board agenda.  The Boardroom Exercise forms one element of the summative assessment (75%) of the module â€“ consisting of the performance of the group within the board meeting and the associated board papers for the meeting.  This is a group-based assessment with individual marks determined by agreed School procedure for peer moderation of performance.  As the Boardroom meeting would be difficult to repeat, any student failing this component of assessment will have a resit opportunity consisting of a 3,000 word individual report focusing upon the performance and proposed strategies of the chosen corporation.  An individual report forms the other element of summative assessment (25%).  It will focus upon the student reflecting upon the skills and knowledge developed both within the core modules and the personal/professional development programme, using the context of the Boardroom Exercise to critically evaluate individual learning and development.

Aims To provide students with the opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation at an advanced level of an issue which is applicable and relevant to business and/or management.   The positioning of the dissertation at the end of the programme is intended to promote integration of material covered in the core and elective phases. Content  Students can choose to pursue either of two types of dissertation: a business project in which they work with a host organisation;  an issue-led investigation which is not focused on just one organisation but instead examines a management issue by, for example, conducting and analysing a survey of  practice in a number of organisations.  The topic (which is formally approved by the Board of Examiners) should be one that is suitable for in-depth investigation.  MBA dissertations have typically been based in a wide variety of organisations, including: profit-seeking companies in both manufacturing and the service sector; nationalised industries; public agencies and local authorities; non-profit seeking organisations; global multinationals; and owner-managed small firms.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically analyse a specific issue or area of management or business in depth and to explore its significance in practice.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically apply knowledge and different forms of reasoning to form a discriminating analysis of issues currently being experienced in specific organisational and business contexts;  be able to conduct an independent piece of advanced research, over a longer period of time than has been possible on the programme hitherto, thereby further developing analytical and research skills needed to explore business and management problems in depth;  produce a substantial piece of written work demonstrating critical analysis of a specific issue.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  have further developed the skills of self-organization and motivation in managing time and activities in working to a deadline.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module Individual meetings with the appointed supervisor, up to 8 but normally 5-6 during the dissertation period.

Aims  To explore in depth the complex environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the key issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation from the standpoints of two core areas of activity: marketing and operations management.  Firstly, the module begins by exploring the network of exchanges between buyers and  sellers in a market economy and the particular role of marketing in facilitating those exchange relationships.  This is then followed by an exploration of the extent to which the organisation-customer interaction is wholly dependent upon effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature of the module is the way in which it not only conceptualises the pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.  Content  The module takes an integrated perspective on two core areas of business activity:  Marketing:  the contexts of marketing; the consumption experience; building relationships; creating â€˜solutionsâ€™; brand selection and brand management; the movement of space and time.  Managing Operations: operations strategy; product and service design; quality management; process design; planning and control; supply chain management; operations improvement.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should have:  developed an integrated and critical appreciation of the key business areas that need to be managed in a competitive operating environment to achieve a holistic view, the emphasis being on process and integration rather than functional 'silos';  developed a critical appreciation of the dynamic pressures of the environment, both internally within the organisation and externally;  developed a critical understanding of the existing theoretical knowledge based on key areas of marketing and operations management.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should:  be able to apply their understanding to the analysis of complex issues in marketing and operations management;  be able to formulate an information-driven strategic response to marketing or operational circumstances.  Key Skills:   Creating a holistic vision.  Building and developing teams.  Negotiating and persuading.  Networking.  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence.  Interpreting and using numerical and financial information.  Reflecting and synthesising from experience.  Developing critical thinking.  Exercising discrimination and judgement.  Synthesising diverse perspectives.  Developing coherent and persuasive arguments.  Selecting appropriate modes of communication.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Learning outcomes will be met through a combination of lectures, groupwork, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading.

Aims To provide students with the opportunity to conduct an in-depth investigation at an advanced level of an issue which is applicable and relevant to business and/or management.   The positioning of the dissertation at the end of the programme is intended to promote integration of material covered in the core and elective phases. Content  Students can choose to pursue either of two types of dissertation: a business project in which they work with a host organisation;  an issue-led investigation which is not focused on just one organisation but instead examines a management issue by, for example, conducting and analysing a survey of  practice in a number of organisations.  The topic (which is formally approved by the Board of Examiners) should be one that is suitable for in-depth investigation.  MBA dissertations have typically been based in a wide variety of organisations, including: profit-seeking companies in both manufacturing and the service sector; nationalised industries; public agencies and local authorities; non-profit seeking organisations; global multinationals; and owner-managed small firms.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically analyse a specific issue or area of management or business in depth and to explore its significance in practice.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  be able to critically apply knowledge and different forms of reasoning to form a discriminating analysis of issues currently being experienced in specific organisational and business contexts;  be able to conduct an independent piece of advanced research, over a longer period of time than has been possible on the programme hitherto, thereby further developing analytical and research skills needed to explore business and management problems in depth;  produce a substantial piece of written work demonstrating critical analysis of a specific issue.  Key Skills:   By the end of the module students should:  have further developed the skills of self-organization and motivation in managing time and activities in working to a deadline.

For students to analyse at least one major organisation on a significant dimension of its â€˜organisational systemâ€™ (e.g. culture, strategy, finance, innovation, HRM).     For students to research and produce either a single detailed case study or a comparative analysis of two organisations, based on desk research prior to the tour and primary research conducted during the tour.    To enhance the employability of students, through exposure to leading international organisations.     To give students an insight into different working environments when they are considering in which sector to start their careers.    Content  Pre-Tour preparation:    In groups, students will thoroughly research a selected organisation in general terms and, in terms of either a strategic analysis focused on a particular area (e.g. innovation, finance, HRM) or on a research topic to be confirmed prior to the tour.   They will produce and present formative group presentations, based on their groupâ€™s desk-research (e.g. published case studies, as well as articles in leading periodicals and newspapers, such as the FT).  They will submit a research plan to the organisers for how they will tackle the topic relevant to each organisation's needs.       The Tour:    The tour will comprise of visits to each of the participating organisations, with time set aside for group work.    During each visit, students will present their analysis to the representatives of the participating organisations.  There will be time for feedback and questions.       The post-Tour report delivery:    After the Tour, individual students submit a summative assignment comprising their own final analysis, either of a single organisation or comparing and contrasting two organisations (2,500 words).  They will also submit a second summative assignment (500 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, what they personally learned about their topic on the Tour, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge in their future career (i.e. â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ activity).     Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students will be able to demonstrate a critical understanding of:    Methods for identifying and presenting a host organisationâ€™s essential dimensions (scale, history, structure, operations and markets, current performance)    Methods for identifying and analysing how the host organisations design and co-ordinate their operations or policies on a given management topic      Critical analysis of how this approach originated, and its impact on operational performance and employee well-being in the host organisations  Organisations as â€˜systemsâ€™     Applied analysis of theory and frameworks at an advanced level inside a real organisation     The benefits and limitations of primary research, especially the production of detailed case studies    Subject-specific Skills:   Ability to identify evidence for the underlying assumptions and theoretical differences in different approaches to particular aspects of organisational systems.    Effective group work, including collaborative effort in the research, drafting, and presentation of a report, as well as interpersonal sensitivity, perhaps across national cultural boundaries.    Desk research and primary research associated with case studies     Ability to appreciate the concept of a â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ and to reflect critically on their own mindsets and practices as a way of learning and developing.    Key Skills:   Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; interpretation of data; computer literacy;  interpersonal skills.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The summative assessment is designed to test the studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding of their chosen topic, and their ability to apply this to contemporary settings. It also tests their capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights.       Because the majority of the learning activity takes place on the tour itself, there will be no formal lectures. Instead, it is planned that there will be three preparatory seminars during Term 2, which will prepare the students for the tour, get them to reflect on case study methodology in the preparation for their formative group presentations, and to agree upon a viable approach to the primary research to be undertaken on the tour itself.       On the tour itself, the participating organisations â€“ having been briefed and having agreed on the overall theme of their visit â€“ will submit to questioning and other forms of primary research. The groups will prepare questions, and assess the evidence for the organisationâ€™s responses to those questions. Free time during the tour will be used to consolidate knowledge, and/or to prepare for visits to the host organisations.

They will also submit a second summative assignment (500 words) detailing their own reflections on the experience, what they personally learned about their topic on the Tour, and how they will make use of this experience and knowledge in their future career (i.e. â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ activity).     Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module, students will be able to demonstrate a critical understanding of:    Methods for identifying and presenting a host organisationâ€™s essential dimensions (scale, history, structure, operations and markets, current performance)    Methods for identifying and analysing how the host organisations design and co-ordinate their operations or policies on a given management topic      Critical analysis of how this approach originated, and its impact on operational performance and employee well-being in the host organisations  Organisations as â€˜systemsâ€™     Applied analysis of theory and frameworks at an advanced level inside a real organisation     The benefits and limitations of primary research, especially the production of detailed case studies    Subject-specific Skills:   Ability to identify evidence for the underlying assumptions and theoretical differences in different approaches to particular aspects of organisational systems.    Effective group work, including collaborative effort in the research, drafting, and presentation of a report, as well as interpersonal sensitivity, perhaps across national cultural boundaries.    Desk research and primary research associated with case studies     Ability to appreciate the concept of a â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ and to reflect critically on their own mindsets and practices as a way of learning and developing.    Key Skills:   Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; interpretation of data; computer literacy;  interpersonal skills.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The summative assessment is designed to test the studentsâ€™ theoretical understanding of their chosen topic, and their ability to apply this to contemporary settings. It also tests their capacity for â€˜reflective practitionerâ€™ insights.       Because the majority of the learning activity takes place on the tour itself, there will be no formal lectures. Instead, it is planned that there will be three preparatory seminars during Term 2, which will prepare the students for the tour, get them to reflect on case study methodology in the preparation for their formative group presentations, and to agree upon a viable approach to the primary research to be undertaken on the tour itself.       On the tour itself, the participating organisations â€“ having been briefed and having agreed on the overall theme of their visit â€“ will submit to questioning and other forms of primary research. The groups will prepare questions, and assess the evidence for the organisationâ€™s responses to those questions. Free time during the tour will be used to consolidate knowledge, and/or to prepare for visits to the host organisations.

Specifically, the module is divided into two distinct study blocks.    Block One is delivered online across a three-month period, divided up into study weeks with specially produced resources within each week. Resources vary according to the learning outcomes of a study week, but normally include: an introductory video, specially-prepared lectures, web-mediated small-group seminars (â€œwebinarsâ€), directed reading, reflection through e-learning activities, and opportunities for self-assessment and peer-to-peer learning within a tutor-facilitated discussion board. Tutors provide feedback on formative work and facilitate discussion board communication as well as being available for individual consultation as necessary (usually by email or video-conferencing). This is identical to the Schoolâ€™s wholly-online distance learning modules, normally delivered over six months, and constitutes 50% of the module. Block One ends with a formative assignment, feedback being provided at the start of Block Two as a platform for classroom-based learning activities.    Normally scheduled for delivery early in the following term to allow successful completion of, and feedback on, all formative elements, Block Two of the module is delivered in the classroom on a block-taught basis. The mode and format of teaching and learning is identical to the Schoolâ€™s part-time MBA taught modules, the study time again being equivalent to 50% of a wholly-taught module. During this taught input, learning outcomes are met through a combination of traditional lectures, groupwork, experiential learning activities, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading and specially-produced audio-visual materials.    The summative assessment of the module is designed to test the acquisition and articulation of knowledge and critical understanding, and skills of application and interpretation within the business context  Teaching Methods and Learning Hours   Activity  Number  Frequency  Duration  Total/Hours     Specially produced lectures, directed reading, self-assessed assignments and guidance for further reading     136     Workshops (a combination of taught input, groupwork, case studies and discussion), timetabled in blocks     14    Total     150   Summative Assessment   Component: Group Project  Component Weighting: 25%    Element  Length / duration  Element Weighting  Resit Opportunity    Online group project, involving the analysis of the social media strategy of a selected organisation, presented in wiki format  Equivalent to the work of a 1000 individual essay  100%  Individual essay, based on a case study analysis    Component: Individual Assignment  Component Weighting: 75%    Element  Length / duration  Element Weighting  Resit Opportunity    Individual reflective learning journal, based around the strategic analysis exercise, presented in weblog format  3000 words  100%  Same   Formative Assessment:  Self-assessed exercises and multiple-choice quizzes ■  Attendance at all activities marked with this symbol will be monitored.

Corequisites  None.  Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  This program will disconnect entrepreneurship and money through embedding the learning of entrepreneurship in value(s). The module adopts a broad definition of enterprise, defined as opportunity identification and value creation â€“ and channels creativity and innovation to create value in the studentâ€™s communities of research and interest.  The aims of the module are as follows:  To contextualise entrepreneurship around innovation, creativity, collaboration, and problem solving.  To reflect that generation, validation and implementation of opportunities is central to building entrepreneurial capacity.  To support the development of entrepreneurial postgraduates through teaching and learning that focuses on a capacity building approach, developing entrepreneurial awareness and capabilities.  To support the development of entrepreneurial mindsets and attitudes â€“ rather than focus solely on skills.  Content  Introduction to entrepreneurship in the 21st century, including an exploration of the characteristics of the successful enterprising graduate, vital to developing an entrepreneurial career.  Intrapreneurship â€“ problem solving and adding value within large organisations.  Appraising enterprising opportunities.  Understanding the task environment â€“ networking to build social capital.  Identifying opportunities to commercialise research.  Understanding how to generate ideas (a broad range of ideas will be encouraged, to offer a multi-faceted approach to problem solving the â€˜real worldâ€™ scenarios).  Opportunities identified may be developed into a range of interventions, such as a research proposal, a social enterprise project or indeed a small commercial venture. This might involve exploring a wide range of ways to protect intellectual property; exploiting IT to enable / support innovation; using presentational skills to create and communicate the â€˜perfect pitchâ€™.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   a critical understanding of the entrepreneurial paradigm of the 21st-century.  a critical awareness of the challenges encountered in the implementation of a new entrepreneurial opportunity.  a detailed understanding of the responses and strategies used to overcome these challenges.  Subject-specific Skills:   the ability to apply a project framework to scope, plan and validate an enterprising opportunity, working as part of a team.  the ability to apply knowledge to explore a complex, problematic situation and identify an opportunity to build an enterprise case.  developed and improved their enterprising skills, behaviours, and attitudes.  Key Skills:   Ability to think critically and creatively and to argue coherently.  Planning, organisation, and time management skills â€“ by working as a team to turning a new idea into a robust enterprise case.  Problem solving and analytical skills e.g. by investigating a â€˜real worldâ€™ problem, designing research, manipulating concepts, and applying analytical skills.  The ability to perform effectively within a team environment, including leadership, team building, influencing, being motivated, monitoring performance, mentoring and coaching and finally project management skills.  Interpersonal skills including effective listening, oral communication, customer/client orientation, negotiating, persuasion and presentation skills.  Skills of effective self-management - in terms of being self-starting; being able to manage autonomously, make decisions on incomplete information and be persistent; and being motivated to take individual initiative and able to plan for action.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  In line with the overall aim of the module - to foster a spirit of entrepreneurialism â€“ students will be offered a supported opportunity to work alongside local enterprises, and to work towards developing their own entrepreneurial career - which may include, but is not exclusive to - setting up their own venture.  This will be achieved through activities that offer the opportunity to explore and gain an understanding of the world of the entrepreneur/business owner, develop an understanding of the skills and attributes, know-how and know-who of the successful entrepreneur and begin the process of applying this knowledge in the creation of sustainable commercial and non-profit making opportunities. The same entrepreneurial attributes are equally relevant to the development of a research career including obtaining funding and managing complex research projects.  The initial intensive workshop will be followed by an opportunity for the students to work in groups over an extended period (6-12 weeks depending on the context. During this post workshop period the groups will participate in tutorial sessions designed to provide support and opportunities to reflect on progress.  The assessment is closely linked to the learning and tests studentsâ€™ ability to plan, complete and reflect on an enterprise project.

These patterns emerge at the interface between internal forces (strategy, marketing, R&D management, operations and knowledge management) and external forces (consumers' adoption of new technologies, regulatory and ethical frameworks, availability of funding for science and technology, national or local approach to societal change). The course will explore the interplay between these forces and discuss frameworks/tools that managers can use to shape or influence the process of technological change.  This course will address the macro and micro aspects of the relationship between technological change, knowledge, management and strategy.  This is designed as a level 4 elective module, building upon topics introduced in the core modules of the MBA.  This is not a technical course addressed to engineers, scientists and R&D people only. This course is for everybody curious to understand how innovation and technology change the context in which company live, prosper and die and what managerial and strategic tools/techniques managers have to control and shape to their own advantage the direction of change. Innovation is about the emergence, diffusion and application of the most powerful competitive force: new technologies. However, change comes in disguise and we often fall pray of Charles Duell's mistake (Charles H. Duell: Commissioner of the US Office of Patents, urging president William McKinley to abolish the Patent Office in 1899):  ""Everything that can be invented has been invented"",  with the consequence that organisations engage in management of incremental change rather than embracing radical approaches.  Content  What is breakthrough innovation? - static models of innovation: ""technology-push"" and ""market-pull"" models, invention and innovation, radical and incremental models.  The evolution of breakthrough innovations: evolutionary models and Christensenâ€™s disruptive/sustaining model of innovation.  The diffusion process and the danger of the â€œchasmâ€: traditional and social network-based approaches to diffusion of innovation.  New product development: how to manage technological innovation within organisations; a review of the historical approaches to new product development.  Current trends in the management of innovation including:  â€œbrokeringâ€ and modularity in breakthrough innovation; emergent innovation and self-organisation; open innovation; the role of communities and lead-users; innovation markets.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students will have a critical understanding of:  the dynamics of technological change and its evolutional properties;  the basic principles of knowledge management.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students will be able to:  critically evaluate techniques for the management of technological innovation within organisations.  Key Skills:   In addition, students will have the opportunity to further develop the following key skills:  Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy;  presentation of complex topics;  group interaction and group dynamic;  case studies analysis.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Learning outcomes will be met through a combination of lectures, groupwork, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading.

Corequisites  None.  Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  To provide a critical understanding of the dynamic patterns of technological change. These patterns emerge at the interface between internal forces (strategy, marketing, R&D management, operations and knowledge management) and external forces (consumers' adoption of new technologies, regulatory and ethical frameworks, availability of funding for science and technology, national or local approach to societal change). The course will explore the interplay between these forces and discuss frameworks/tools that managers can use to shape or influence the process of technological change.  This course will address the macro and micro aspects of the relationship between technological change, knowledge, management and strategy.  This is designed as a level 4 elective module, building upon topics introduced in the core modules of the MBA.  This is not a technical course addressed to engineers, scientists and R&D people only. This course is for everybody curious to understand how innovation and technology change the context in which company live, prosper and die and what managerial and strategic tools/techniques managers have to control and shape to their own advantage the direction of change. Innovation is about the emergence, diffusion and application of the most powerful competitive force: new technologies. However, change comes in disguise and we often fall pray of Charles Duell's mistake (Charles H. Duell: Commissioner of the US Office of Patents, urging president William McKinley to abolish the Patent Office in 1899):  ""Everything that can be invented has been invented"",  with the consequence that organisations engage in management of incremental change rather than embracing radical approaches.  Content  What is breakthrough innovation? - static models of innovation: ""technology-push"" and ""market-pull"" models, invention and innovation, radical and incremental models.  The evolution of breakthrough innovations: evolutionary models and Christensen's disruptive/sustaining model of innovation.  The diffusion process and the danger of the ""chasm"": traditional and social network-based approaches to diffusion of innovation.  New product development: how to manage technological innovation within organisations; a review of the historical approaches to new product development.  Current trends in the management of innovation including:  ""brokering"" and modularity in breakthrough innovation; emergent innovation and self-organisation; open innovation; the role of communities and lead-users; innovation markets.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students will have a critical understanding of:  the dynamics of technological change and its evolutional properties;  the basic principles of knowledge management.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students will be able to:  critically evaluate techniques for the management of technological innovation within organisations.  Key Skills:   In addition, students will have the opportunity to further develop the following key skills:  Written communication; planning, organising and time management; problem solving and analysis; using initiative; computer literacy;  presentation of complex topics;  group interaction and group dynamic;  case studies analysis.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Learning outcomes will be met through a combination of lectures, groupwork, case studies and discussion, supported by guided reading.  The written assignment, 2500 words in total, will require students to answer specific question(s) designed to test their critical understanding of relevant concepts.  The group presentation, requiring evaluation of a chosen technology in the context of relevant strategic innovation frameworks, will also test students' ability to work effectively in collaboration with others and to critically assess the relevance and validity of others' views.

Corequisites  None.  Excluded Combination of Modules  MANAGING IN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT (ONLINE)  Aims  To explore in depth the complex environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the key issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation from the standpoints of two core areas of activity: marketing and operations management.  Firstly, the module begins by exploring the network of exchanges between buyers and  sellers in a market economy and the particular role of marketing in facilitating those exchange relationships.  This is then followed by an exploration of the extent to which the organisation-customer interaction is wholly dependent upon effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature of the module is the way in which it not only conceptualises the pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.  Content  The module takes an integrated perspective on two core areas of business activity:  Marketing:  the contexts of marketing; the consumption experience; building relationships; creating â€˜solutionsâ€™; brand selection and brand management; the movement of space and time.  Managing Operations: operations strategy; product and service design; quality management; process design; planning and control; supply chain management; operations improvement.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should have:  developed an integrated and critical appreciation of the key business areas that need to be managed in a competitive operating environment to achieve a holistic view, the emphasis being on process and integration rather than functional 'silos';  developed a critical appreciation of the dynamic pressures of the environment, both internally within the organisation and externally;  developed a critical understanding of the existing theoretical knowledge base on key areas of marketing and operations management.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  be able to apply their understanding to the analysis of complex issues in marketing and operations management;  be able to formulate an information-driven strategic response to marketing or operational circumstances.

The assessment of the module, by written assignment and photo essay plus accompanying text, is designed to test students' knowledge and understanding of the subject-matter and their ability to apply it to the analysis of specific issues relating to the study of managing and organising.  A photo essay is a deliberately constructed sequence of photographs that present a critical narrative on life, work or society and are intended to evoke questions and emotions within the viewer, thus encouraging an approach to learning in which are â€œuncovering the topics in our course rather than listening to us cover themâ€ (Whetten, 2007, p349).  By requiring students to reconsider their â€˜Ways of Seeingâ€™ (Berger, 1972) the photo essay encourages them to think again about the underlying rationales and challenges in establishing, managing and organising a social enterprise and to do so in a manner which is qualitatively different from written deliberation alone.

This module allows the student to explore the multi-disciplinary nature of general management by seeing the application of all these functional disciplines within the setting of the corporate boardroom.  The module is centred on the Boardroom Exercise which is a small-group activity (typically 5 â€“ 8 students) that runs within the second stage of the MBA programme.  Students are allocated to groups and simulate the behaviour of the executive management team of a specified real-world organisation as they prepare for and participate in a simulation of a board meeting of the corporation. This meeting is chaired by an external executive with extensive board experience along with other similar external executives and academic staff who undertake the role of non-executive directors.  Following the meeting, the executive management team also needs to prepare and conduct an investorsâ€™ briefing (in the form of a web conference).  The activity is designed to provide an opportunity for experiential learning, with the group carefully searching for and analysing relevant information; preparing an agreed agenda and board papers for the meeting; participating as specified members of the executive management team within the meeting and, finally, preparing, presenting and facing questions upon the subsequent investors briefing.  In addition to the group-based activities outlined above, each student will write an individual report that reflects upon their learning from the core modules and skills development programme as it applies to the boardroom exercise and their broader professional development.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should:  Have a critical appreciation of corporate governance structures, processes and policy development as they apply to the activities of a corporate board; the roles and responsibilities of executive and non executive directors; and the effective performance of company boards;  Have an advanced understanding of how the disciplines of general management can be integrated and used to effectively manage the strategic development and performance of an international company;  Have an advanced understanding of the typical challenges faced by international business organisations and the development of options available to address them.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  Be able to think strategically and critically about the performance of an international corporation, as well as functionally;  Be able to critically analyse the internal, market and non-market environments of the corporation in order to understand the strategic constraints and opportunities it faces to address current and future performance;  Be able to develop, as part of a team, detailed and integrated management reports that explain current corporate performance and/or define management actions to address performance and contribute to the future strategic development of the corporation;  Be able to articulate and persuade groups like non executive directors and the broader investment community that the executive management team has a clear understanding of current corporate performance and the ability to drive successful future performance;  Be able to think self-critically about their managerial knowledge and professional skills, identifying gaps and opportunities for continued personal development.  Key Skills:   Building and developing teams  Negotiating and persuading  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence  Interpreting and using numerical and financial information  Reflecting and synthesising from experience  Developing critical thinking  Synthesising diverse perspectives  Developing coherent and persuasive arguments  Selecting appropriate modes of communication  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Whilst not part of the teaching input into this module, students will be expected to draw on the content and skills developed in core modules.  A series of lectures/presentations will examine issues of corporate governance structures & processes; the roles and responsibilities of directors and boards; the composition of effective boards; the nature of board papers and investor communications.  This will also include a panel-based discussion drawing on the collective experience and expertise of the senior executives acting as board chairmen.  A workshop on effective boardroom behaviour will examine and develop thinking, listening and communicating skills, drawing on the latest thinking on effective leadership approaches.  Appropriate links will be drawn to the wider programme of professional and personal skills and development.  The workshop will be followed by group-based coaching in both effective board behaviours and upon the content of the board papers, board meeting and investor briefing.  There will also be a pre-board meeting (effectively a rehearsal of the full board meeting) led by the module teaching team â€“ which will simulate the meeting and provide verbal feedback to the group.  In addition, the groups will have the opportunity to draw on the skills/mentoring of their board chairman though informal meetings and web/telephone communication throughout the Boardroom Exercise.  This includes the Chairman leading the feedback session, alongside the other non executive directors, immediately after the full board meeting.  The boardroom groups will need to spend considerable time, both together and individually, analyzing the chosen company, evaluating its performance and strategy, devising and evaluating strategic responses and preparing the relevant documents (board papers) for consideration.  Typically, the groups will need to meet as a management team on a regular basis, providing executive management committee minutes to the board chairman and seeking approval/guidance in the development of the board agenda.  The Boardroom Exercise forms one element of the summative assessment (75%) of the module â€“ consisting of the performance of the group within the board meeting, the associated board papers for the meeting, and the investor briefing (a web-based presentation) prepared following the board meeting.  This is a group-based assessment with individual marks determined by agreed School procedure for peer moderation of performance.  As the Boardroom meeting would be difficult to repeat, any student failing this component of assessment will have a resit opportunity consisting of a 3,000 word individual report focusing upon the performance and proposed strategies of the chosen corporation.  The individual report forms the other element of summative assessment (25%).  It will focus upon the student reflecting upon the skills and knowledge developed both within the core modules and the personal/professional development programme, using the context of the Boardroom Exercise to critically evaluate individual learning and development.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The module provides students with the opportunity to engage as a group with a research project outside their usual workplace in an international development context. The project provides students with an opportunity to put their learning into practice and then enhance their learning by reflecting on their experience.  The main modes of learning are from the on-the-ground work associated with the particular project that is undertaken, and from the associated academic material on development and social enterprise.  The teaching input will take two forms. Initially there will be some relatively didactic input introducing students to the theoretical underpinnings of development and social enterprise.  It will then move to a more supportive role as students begin to work on their project, providing practical advice and reinforcing the theoretical input in relation to the particular project(s). There may also be some further didactic input dependent upon the specific  nature of the project(s). The final element of teaching will take place after the project work  has been completed and will largely consist in providing feedback on an initial draft of the project report together with input on how to produce a critical and reflective individual report.  The assessment consists of a group report on the project work (75%) and an individual reflective report on the learning that the team members each gained from the project itself (25%). These reports will enable reflection on the project as a whole including: the linkage between theory and practice; the process and outcome of the project; the effectiveness of the team; and the lessons learned.

Aims  To explore in depth the complex environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the key issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation from the standpoints of two core areas of activity: marketing and operations management.  Firstly, the module begins by exploring the network of exchanges between buyers and  sellers in a market economy and the particular role of marketing in facilitating those exchange relationships.  This is then followed by an exploration of the extent to which the organisation-customer interaction is wholly dependent upon effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature of the module is the way in which it not only conceptualises the pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.  Content  The module takes an integrated perspective on two core areas of business activity:  Marketing:  the contexts of marketing; the consumption experience; building relationships; creating â€˜solutionsâ€™; brand selection and brand management; the movement of space and time.  Managing Operations: operations strategy; product and service design; quality management; process design; planning and control; supply chain management; operations improvement.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students should have:  developed an integrated and critical appreciation of the key business areas that need to be managed in a competitive operating environment to achieve a holistic view, the emphasis being on process and integration rather than functional 'silos';  developed a critical appreciation of the dynamic pressures of the environment, both internally within the organisation and externally;  developed a critical understanding of the existing theoretical knowledge based on key areas of marketing and operations management.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, the students will:  be able to apply their understanding to the analysis of complex issues in marketing and operations management;  be able to formulate an information-driven strategic response to marketing or operational circumstances.  Key Skills:   Creating a holistic vision.  Building and developing teams.  Negotiating and persuading.  Networking.  Sourcing appropriate data and evaluating evidence.  Interpreting and using numerical and financial information.  Reflecting and synthesising from experience.  Developing critical thinking.  Exercising discrimination and judgement.

Excluded Combination of Modules  BUSI45O15: Managing in the Competitive Environment (Taught)  Aims  To explore in depth the complex environmental pressures at work on organisations, how they can respond to these influences, and the key issues involved in aligning with these forces.  Specifically, the module takes an integrated perspective of the operating environment of the organisation from the standpoints of two core areas of activity: marketing and operations management.  Firstly, the module begins by exploring the network of exchanges between buyers and  sellers in a market economy and the particular role of marketing in facilitating those exchange relationships.  This is then followed by an exploration of the extent to which the organisation-customer interaction is wholly dependent upon effective operational management in terms of the design, planning, control, forecasting and management of resources.  A particular feature of the module is the way in which it not only conceptualises the pressures faced by organisations, but also identifies the main issues that need to be addressed by individual managers.  Content  The module takes an integrated perspective on two core areas of business activity:  Marketing:  the contexts of marketing; the consumption experience; building relationships; creating â€˜solutionsâ€™; brand selection and brand management; the movement of space and time.  Managing Operations: operations strategy; product and service design; quality management; process design; planning and control; supply chain management; operations improvement.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students should have:  developed an integrated and critical appreciation of the key business areas that need to be managed in a competitive operating environment to achieve a holistic view, the emphasis being on process and integration rather than functional 'silos';  developed a critical appreciation of the dynamic pressures of the environment, both internally within the organisation and externally;  developed a critical understanding of the existing theoretical knowledge base on key areas of marketing and operations management.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of this module, students should:  be able to apply their understanding to the analysis of complex issues in marketing and operations management;  be able to formulate an information-driven strategic response to marketing or operational circumstances.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Lectures and tutorials, supported by guided reading, will be used to introduce and explore the key concepts and theories.  Group exercises  and group discussions will help students develop their own synthesised models which the assignments and mentor support will help them adapt and apply to the specific needs of their own organisation.  The workplace visits allow students to compare results of the ICT audits and consider what is feasible in their own organisations.  The two summative assignments will require the student to (1) undertake a technology audit inside their own organisation and (2) produce a proposal for the development of a technology strategy with a consideration of implementation issues within their organisational context.

It is no longer based primarily on conceptual content, relying on mental models, deep insights and years of experience to formulate marketing decisions, the New Marketing instead resembles design engineering - it consists of putting together data, models, analysis, and computer simulations in order to learn about the marketplace and to design effective strategic marketing plans.   To provide a comprehensive introduction to Quantitative Marketing Research (or ""Marketing Engineering""); the application of mathematical decision models in the formulation of marketing management decisions.  Specifically, the module demonstrates how mathematical models and statistical techniques can be used to transform objective and subjective data about the marketing environment into informed management decisions and decision implementations.    Based around both Microsoft Excel and the SPSS statistical package, the module explores both the conceptual knowledge underpinning quantitative marketing decision models and the practical skills needed to generate those models and computer simulations.  Participants MUST therefore be confident in both their own statistical abilities and IT skills and have a good working knowledge of Microsoft Excel.

Aims  To develop specialised knowledge in theories of behavioural economics and finance, and test these theories using methods in experimental economics.  Content  The module is designed to combine the behavioural approach in economics and finance with active classroom experiments. These experiments illustrate simple economic situations, such as markets or auctions, and are used to highlight several economic ideas. We will critically review studies of economic behaviour in markets, bargaining, auctions, game theory, and public choice. We will also discuss key aspects of individual behaviour in isolation, in particular choice under uncertainty and choice over time.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students will:  have a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of experimental methods in economics;  have a critical understanding of methodological considerations including sample design and selection, design of experimental treatments, incentives, control and psychological biases.

Corequisites  EITHER Advanced Financial Theory (ECON41215) OR Advanced Microeconomics (ECON44715)  Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  To develop specialised knowledge in theories of behavioural economics and finance, and test these theories using methods in experimental economics.  Content  The module is designed to combine the behavioural approach in economics and finance with active classroom experiments. These experiments illustrate simple economic situations, such as markets or auctions, and are used to highlight several economic ideas. We will critically review studies of economic behaviour in markets, bargaining, auctions, game theory, and public choice. We will also discuss key aspects of individual behaviour in isolation, in particular choice under uncertainty and choice over time.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   By the end of the module students will:  have a comprehensive and detailed knowledge of experimental methods in economics;  have a critical understanding of methodological considerations including sample design and selection, design of experimental treatments, incentives, control and psychological biases.  Subject-specific Skills:   By the end of the module students will:  be able to critically evaluate experiments in economics run in the lab and the field, and the resulting behavioural insights and theoretical predictions;  be able to design experimental treatments that can identify and test these predictions;  be able to critically reflect on sample design and self-selection into experiments.  Key Skills:   Analytical and statistical understanding  Written communication  Planning and organisation  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  A combination of lectures, seminars and guided reading will contribute to achieving the aims and learning outcomes of this module.  Classroom experiments will be an essential part of teaching.  The summative examination will be designed to test the studentsâ€™ critical knowledge and understanding of experimental methods, methodological considerations, and outcomes including their ability to design and critically reflect on appropriate experimental treatments.  This will be an open book examination.

Content  The module starts with an introduction covering the general topics, the learning objectives, the course structure and the assessment criteria.  The following lectures present the theoretical background to the problem of environmental degradation by dealing with issues of welfare economics.  In the main part of the module, the theory of externalities implied by air pollution is analysed.  An externality occurs when the decisions of one agent affect the utility or production decisions of other agents in an unintended way.  If decisions are being made without taking account of the externalities, a Pareto-optimal allocation will not arise, and government intervention is desirable in the forms of pollution standards, emissions taxes and tradable permits.  Applications are extensively provided.  Subsequently, the module deals with natural resources and the international dimension of environmental policy when pollution is transboundary and may have global effects such as global warming, biodiversity loss, depletion of the ozone layer.  The problems related to the design and implementation of international environmental agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997) will be analysed.  The course is also concerned with optimal environmental policy when voting behaviour and the effects of lobby groups are taken into account.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   have an advanced knowledge and critical understanding of the contribution of economic analysis to the solution of complex environmental problems;  have a critical appreciation of the role of free markets and/or government intervention to deal with complex environmental problems;  have a critical knowledge of, and be able to engage in advanced discussion of, current political strategies for the protection of the environment from an economic standpoint;  have explored, understood and appreciated the complexity and contradictions of the current academic literature and its implications for professional practice, and be able to identify open questions for their own research.  Subject-specific Skills:   be able to solve complex optimisation problems algebraically, and make use of graphical analysis at an advanced level.  Key Skills:   Written Communication;  Planning, Organising and Time Management;  Problem Solving and Analysis;  Using initiative;  Numeracy;  Computer Literacy.
