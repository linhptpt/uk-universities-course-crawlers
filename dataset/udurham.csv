To provide experience of a research-led public engagement project in Engineering.  To allow students to make an in-depth study of a particular topic in Engineering, to undertake extensive independent research and to write at length on their chosen subject in the context of public engagement.  To develop a range of transferable skills in researching a topic in the context of public engagement and making oral and written presentations on their work.  To learn to devise and develop Engineering projects and public engagement methods appropriate to the chosen topic and relevant audience(s).    Content  Project: A research-led public engagement project, set in collaboration with members of staff from the Department, and possibly with an external partner, allowing students to present the results of individual and independent work (note: an original contribution to scientific knowledge is not required or expected).  The student will implement and evaluate the project. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific public engagement problem and devise and develop an appropriate public engagement approach to address that specific problem.  Students will choose from a wide list of broad possible topics. Each student will be assigned a member of staff as supervisor. Students will devise their own approach to researching and communicating their subject with advice from their supervisor. As part of their work they will be expected to address some of the specific aspects of their subject with the agreement of the supervisor. Students will be expected to work independently, to manage the direction of their work and to employ a significant component of self-directed learning.  Reflective practice: The student will keep a reflective journal of activity and produce an executive summary of that journal, summarising and communicating their reflective practice in relation to their project.  Transferable skills including time-management, presentation, communication, organisation, prioritisation and negotiation skills.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Having studied this module, students:  Will have formed a detailed appreciation of the Engineering related to a particular topic.  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of public engagement.

Will have demonstrated the ability to engage in reflective practice and produce a clear and detailed piece of reflective writing with appropriate presentation, reflecting on their work.  Will have demonstrated the ability to develop and deliver a clear and engaging oral presentation on their work    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes a series of tutorials and the development and delivery of a project on a topic within Engineering in the context of public engagement.  An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Engineering, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes a series of tutorials and the development and delivery of a project on a topic within Physics in the context of public engagement.  An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Physics, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Teaching will be by lectures, practical sessions, workshops and project work.    The open-ended â€˜bridge projectâ€™ is undertaken in June of the previous academic year, providing a transition from Level 1 to Level 2 practical work.  Students will work in teams on an extended project lasting the equivalent of one week, which will develop their problem-solving and teamwork skills.  (Students who are unable, for good reason, to undertake the bridge project in June will undertake an equivalent project in the following Easter Term.)    The practical sessions are small group activities designed to develop skills in data interpretation, experiment design, team working, specific practical techniques and reporting, and critical reading of relevant scientific papers. The skills covered form the foundation needed for the research-led investigation in the second term and for later practical work. Students will be able to obtain help and guidance from discussions with laboratory demonstrators.    The electronics course aims to give a theoretical grounding in the elements of electronics â€“ analogue circuits, interfacing using microcontrollers â€“ with practical activities to provide a working knowledge of the subject.   The computational physics lectures aim to give a theoretical grounding in the elements of computational physics and numerical methods, while the workshops provide opportunities for practice and discussion of the algorithms.    Regular exercises in coding algorithms, to be submitted and checked electronically, will give students practice in applying these principles and will form the basis for discussion in the workshops.  Student performance is summatively assessed through an online report on the â€˜bridge projectâ€™, through a formal report for the skills sessions, through an electronics practical assessment exercise, through a formal report for the research-led investigation and through exercises.    The practical classes, workshops and exercises provide opportunity for feedback, for students to gauge their progress and for staff to monitor progress throughout the duration of the module.

To help students gain confidence in communicating Physics, develop strong organisational and interpersonal skills, and understand how to address the needs of individuals.  To learn to devise and develop Physics projects and teaching methods appropriate to engage the relevant age group they are working with.  To help inspire a new generation of Physicists as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.  To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Physics.  To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.  Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term.  This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class.  The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  Special projects: The student will devise a special Physics project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with.  The student will implement the special project and evaluate it.  The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils.  The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of teaching in schools.  Will have an advanced understanding of Physics through having to explain to others.  Will have an advanced understanding of the problems of public perception of science.  Subject-specific Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will know the responsibilites and appropriate conduct for a teacher.  Will know how to give (and take) feedback on Physics issues.  Will be able to undertake public speaking on Physics generally.  Will know how to prepare lesson plans and teaching materials for Physics.  Key Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to communicate effectively, both one to one and with small groups.  Will be able to understand the needs of individuals.  Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.  Will be able to improvise when necessary.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.  Will know how to work with others in teams.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.    The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skils (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.     The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Physics education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.   The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.    The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their experience of the school placement and on their own personal development, and to demonstrate written communication skills.    The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.    The Teacher's Assessment is an independent corroboration of progress, including the student's approach and attitude, appreciation of key educational issues, aptitude and potential as a science communicator and performance in the Special Project.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Teaching will be by lectures, practical sessions, workshops and project work.    The open-ended â€˜bridge projectâ€™ is undertaken in June of the previous academic year, providing a transition from Level 1 to Level 2 practical work.  Students will work in teams on an extended project lasting the equivalent of one week, which will develop their problem-solving and teamwork skills.  (Students who are unable, for good reason, to undertake the bridge project in June will undertake an equivalent project in the following Easter Term.)    The practical sessions are small group activities designed to develop skills in data interpretation, experiment design, team working, specific practical techniques and reporting, and critical reading of relevant scientific papers. The skills covered form the foundation needed for the research-led investigation in the second term and for later practical work. Students will be able to obtain help and guidance from discussions with laboratory demonstrators.    The electronics course aims to give a theoretical grounding in the elements of electronics â€“ analogue circuits, interfacing using microcontrollers â€“ with practical activities to provide a working knowledge of the subject.    The computational physics lectures aim to give a theoretical grounding in the elements of computational physics and numerical methods, while the workshops provide opportunities for practice and discussion of the algorithms.    Regular exercises in coding algorithms, to be submitted and checked electronically, will give students practice in applying these principles and will form the basis for discussion in the workshops.  Student performance is summatively assessed through an online report on the â€˜bridge projectâ€™, through a formal report for the skills sessions, through an electronics practical assessment exercise, through a formal report for the research-led investigation and through exercises.    The practical classes, workshops and exercises provide opportunity for feedback, for students to gauge their progress and for staff to monitor progress throughout the duration of the module.

Corequisites  One 20 credit Level 4 mathematics module.   Excluded Combination of Modules  Level 4 projects in any other Department.  Aims  To allow an undergraduate to conduct a substantial piece ofmathematical work as an individual initiative, and to write up and present it in a scholarly fashion.  This will further the students' analytical skills and theirabilities in oral and written communication.  Content  Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied inthe topics they address and in the type of approachrequired.  Some projects will need extensive computation or dataanalysis, some will be entirely theoretical, many will include bothsorts of approach.  All allow opportunity for initiative by the student, andare open-ended in that they offer scope for considerably more work thancan be achieved in the available time.  Some projects may involve an element of groupwork.  A first-class project derives not only from technicalflair, other important ingredients are good management andorganisation.  Management of the project is the responsibility of thestudent, however, the student must seek, and take advantage of theadvice of the supervisor.  The contents of the project is expected to be at a level of sophistication, detail and explanation appropriate to Level 4 Mathematics.        Project work starts at the beginning of the 4thyear.  A short oral presentation of the work is given near theend of the second term, accompanied by a publicly displayedposter.  The written report is submitted by the end of the firstweek of Easter term.  A report is judged principally on the quality of itscontent and its structure, good typographical presentation is a minorfactor, although poor typography can detract from thereport.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Students will have conducted a substantial piece of mathematical work, as an individual initiative, and have written it upas a project and presented it in a fashion appropriate to an audienceof their peers.  The work will demonstrate understanding of a specialised andcomplex theoretical mathematics and show mastery of a coherent body ofknowledge.  Subject-specific Skills:  Key Skills:   The students will have enhanced analytical skills andabilities in oral and written communication.  Students will have the ability to critically review andreport on a specialised area of knowledge.  Students will have the ability to synthesize and integratematerial from diverse mathematical sources.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The assessment for the poster and oral presentation of theproject (worth 15% of the marks) gives means to measure how wellstudents communicate the results of their investigations to an audienceof level 4 mathematics students.

An ability to manage one's affairs and to be assessed within an overseas environment.            An ability to communicate, both orally and in writing, mathematically and socially in a foreign language.        Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module        Sample tutorials and a practice oral examination delivered in the appropriate foreign language prior to year abroad will provide preparation for tuition in a non-English speaking country during the year abroad.          While abroad, lectures, problem classes and homework problems will be experienced in a foreign language at an overseas Mathematics Department. Students are introduced to most of the basic concepts and techniques in mathematics in lectures; their knowledge and understanding are reinforced in tutorials, homework problems and/or problems classes through attempting problems embodying the concepts. The year abroad enhances students' perception of the universality of the scientific method, although they study mathematics in a novel environment, and are exposed to a different learning culture.          Students will also produce a short (approximately four pages) experiential essay written in a foreign language contrasting their mathematical experience in Durham and abroad.          Assessment (other than of the experiential essay) will be carried out by the European university. This will typically involve one or more of written examinations, oral examinations, marking of homework problems. The assessment of experiential essay will be undertaken by an appropriate member of the Durham Mathematics Department. These various methods of assessment will test knowledge and understanding at the appropriate levels in the context of the specific mathematical material, as well as reflecting the language skills of the student.          The assessments within the overseas institution will show that the student is able to understand and communicate subject content delivered in a different language, and to work successfully in a different international environment.          Teaching methods and contact hours will depend on the overseas partner university, but the following is indicative.

Corequisites  None  Excluded Combination of Modules  All other Public Engagement in Science modules: BIOL CHEM COMP GEOL PHYS ENGI   Aims  This module is designed primarily for students studying Department of Mathematical Sciences or Natural Sciences degree programmes.  To provide experience of a research-led public engagement project in Mathematical Sciences.  To allow students to make an in-depth study of a particular topic in Mathematical Sciences, to undertake extensive independent research and to write at length on their chosen subject in the context of public engagement.  To develop a range of transferable skills in researching a topic in the context of public engagement and making oral and written presentations on their work.  To learn to devise and develop Mathematical Sciences projects and public engagement methods appropriate to the chosen topic and relevant audience(s).    Content  Project: A research-led public engagement project, set in collaboration with members of staff from the Department, and possibly with an external partner, allowing students to present the results of individual and independent work (note: an original contribution to scientific knowledge is not required or expected).  The student will implement and evaluate the project. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific public engagement problem and devise and develop an appropriate public engagement approach to address that specific problem.  Students will choose from a wide list of broad possible topics. Each student will be assigned a member of staff as supervisor. Students will devise their own approach to researching and communicating their subject with advice from their supervisor. As part of their work they will be expected to address some of the specific aspects of their subject with the agreement of the supervisor. Students will be expected to work independently, to manage the direction of their work and to employ a significant component of self-directed learning.  Reflective practice: The student will keep a reflective journal of activity and produce an executive summary of that journal, summarising and communicating their reflective practice in relation to their project.  Transferable skills including time-management, presentation, communication, organisation, prioritisation and negotiation skills.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Having studied this module, students:  Will have formed a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of public engagement.    Subject-specific Skills:   In addition to the acquisition of subject knowledge, students:  Will be able to design and develop public engagement activities.  Will be able to communicate scientific concepts to a non-specialist audience.  Will have the skills to plan and carry out an extended project at an advanced level.  Will have demonstrated critical understanding of scientific background and pedagogical theories and practices.    Key Skills:   Having studied this module, students:  Will be able to manage their time effectively.  Will be able to communicate effectively.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate effectively.  Will have demonstrated the ability to advance and extend their knowledge through significant independent learning and research.  Will have demonstrated the ability to produce a clear and detailed written report with appropriate presentation on their work.  Will have demonstrated the ability to engage in reflective practice and produce a clear and detailed piece of reflective writing with appropriate presentation, reflecting on their work.  Will have demonstrated the ability to develop and deliver a clear and engaging oral presentation on their work.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes a series of tutorials and the development and delivery of a project on a topic within Mathematical Sciences in the context of public engagement.  An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Mathematical Sciences, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

Aims  This module is designed solely for students studying Department of Engineering MEng degree programmes.  To develop a range of key skills in the student and to offer an early taste of teaching Engineering to those interested in pursuing it as a career of for other career pathways where public understanding of science is required.  To help students gain confidence in communicating Engineering, develop strong organisational and interpersonal skills, and understand how to address the needs of individuals.  To learn to devise and develop Engineering projects and teaching methods appropriate to engage the relevant age group they are working with.  To help inspire a new generation of Engineering as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.  To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Engineering.  To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.  Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term.  This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class.  The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  Special projects: The student will devise a special Engineering project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with.  The student will implement the special project and evaluate it.  The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils.  The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.   Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of teaching in schools.  Will have an advanced understanding of Engineering through having to explain to others.  Will have an advanced understanding of the problems of public perception of science.  Recognise the apparent contradictions in Engineering Education and suggest areas for further investigation.  Subject-specific Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will know the responsibilities and appropriate conduct for a teacher.  Will know how to give (and take) feedback on Engineering issues.  Will be able to undertake public speaking on Engineering generally.  Will know how to prepare lesson plans and teaching materials for Engineering.  Identify appropriate fields of enquiry and determine an appropriate investigative methodology.  Key Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to communicate effectively, both one to one and with small groups.  Will be able to understand the needs of individuals.  Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.  Will be able to improvise when necessary.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.  Will know how to work with others in teams.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.    The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skills (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.     The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Engineering education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.   The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.    The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their own personal development, on their experience of school and the organisation of teaching and on pupils' science learning, and to demonstrate written communication skills.    The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.    The Teacher's Assessment is an independent corroboration of progress, including the student's approach, attitude, appreciation of key educational skills and performance in the Special Project.

These skills are absolutely essential for a wide range of science careers, across industry and academia.     The first specific aim is to develop a clearer and more effective writing style, which can be easily understood. A good writing style is necessary for all types of scientific document.     The second aim is learn how best to write critical scientific summaries, journal papers, press releases, and grant proposals. Writing exercises will be based initially on presentations (with associated background reading of linked papers) by external speakers, and then on a journal article related to the studentâ€™s own research.     A third aim is to give more effective oral presentations (talks). This will include learning from oral presentations by external speakers, and advice from the course team.    The final aim is to be able to critically assess and summarise new cutting-edge scientific topics, through presentations by external speakers in department seminars.   Content  The first part of the course will focus on developing a more effective writing style. This will be done through a combination of themed workshops, and feedback on writing assignments.   Writing assignments (e.g. critical scientific summaries) will be linked initially to science presented by external speakers within departmental seminars, and to associated background reading of linked papers.   These seminars will expose students to a wide range of cutting-edge science, and help to develop skills in understanding and critically evaluating science in new topics.     Informal analysis of departmental seminars, and a workshop on giving talks, will develop more effective oral presentation skills.   The second part of the course will develop skills in writing different types of scientific document, such as press releases, journal articles, and funding proposals. Press releases will be linked to material presented by external speaks in department seminars. The final writing exercise will set out to improve a journal article, and future funding proposal, based on the studentâ€™s own recent research.   Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Why scientific writing and oral presentation skills matters for a wide range of careers.   How to write more effectively.   How to give more effective scientific talks.    How to write scientific papers, press releases, and funding proposals.   Departmental seminars will also expose students to a wider range of cutting-edge science.  Subject-specific Skills:   The course will seek to improve basic writing and oral presenting skills.   Skills will also be developed in writing different types of scientific document, such as press releases, papers and funding proposals.     Skills in critical analysis of new science will be gained via summaries of work presented by external speakers, and reading of linked papers.  Key Skills:   More effective scientific writing (including punctuation, structure and brevity).  More effective presentation skills; including how to prepare and deliver talks.  Skills in critically analysing and summarising new scientific topics, via external speakers and linked background reading.    Writing press releases, and knowledge of wider issues around working with the media.    How to write a well-structured scientific paper, including the need for clear messages.    Skills in writing funding proposals, including skills in identifying new and important scientific questions and how to tackle them.   Time management and working to deadlines.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  More effective writing skills will be developed through themed workshops, linked to text books on writing, and a series of short scientific writing exercises.     Some of the writing exercises will be linked to talks by external speakers in department seminars and linked papers, which will also expose students to new topics in cutting-edge science.    The first (formative) assessment aims to develop an effective basic writing style. It will involve critically analysing and summarising a new topic presented by an external speaker, and this will involve both the presentation and a background reading list of papers.    The second (summative) exercise will involve a press release on a topic presented by a second external department seminar speaker. The student will also read more widely on the presentation topic. This will help to develop skills and knowledge in dealing with the media.   A final (summative) exercise will have two parts with equal weight. First, it will involve a scientific journal article on the studentâ€™s own research. This exercise may start with a draft EPSL journal paper that has previously submitted for their Level 4 research project, which will be improved further. Second, a funding proposal will be written for further research, which may be linked to the studentâ€™s previous research project.

To help students gain confidence in communicating Earth Sciences, develop strong organisational and interpersonal skills, and understand how to address the needs of individuals.  To learn to devise and develop Earth Sciences projects and teaching methods appropriate to engage the relevant age group they are working with.  To help inspire a new generation of Earth Scientists as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.  To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Earth Sciences.  To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.  Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term.  This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class.  The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  Special projects: The student will devise a special Earth Sciences project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with.  The student will implement the special project and evaluate it.  The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils.  The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of teaching in schools.  Will have an advanced understanding of Earth Sciences through having to explain to others.

Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.  Will be able to improvise when necessary.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.  Will know how to work with others in teams.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.    The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skils (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.     The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Earth Sciences education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.   The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.    The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their own personal development, on their experience of school and the organisation of teaching and on pupils' science learning, and to demonstrate written communication skills.    The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.

To critically analyse background literature within their chosen domain in order to set their work in context.   To enhance students skills in writing up and presenting work in a scholarly fashion.   Content  Students are expected to choose a project from a list offered by potential supervisors, or to propose their own project and find a suitable supervisor.  Projects are inevitably and deliberately very varied in the topic they address and in the type of approach required; the common factor is that they are research-led.  For example they may be practically or theoretically based. Many projects will consist of a combination of these.  All projects are open-ended and contain considerably more work than can be achieved in the available time. Students therefore need to evaluate the problem domain and propose the elements of the greater problem they will address.  Project work starts at the beginning of the 4th year.  One of the main outcomes of the project is a significant academic-quality report.  Successful completion requires good organisation, communication skills and management.

To provide experience of a research-led public engagement project in Computer Science.  To allow students to make an in-depth study of a particular topic in Computer Science, to undertake extensive independent research and to write at length on their chosen subject in the context of public engagement.  To develop a range of transferable skills in researching a topic in the context of public engagement and making oral and written presentations on their work.  To learn to devise and develop Computer Science projects and public engagement methods appropriate to the chosen topic and relevant audience(s).    Content  Project: A research-led public engagement project, set in collaboration with members of staff from the Department, and possibly with an external partner, allowing students to present the results of individual and independent work (note: an original contribution to scientific knowledge is not required or expected).  The student will implement and evaluate the project. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific public engagement problem and devise and develop an appropriate public engagement approach to address that specific problem.  Students will choose from a wide list of broad possible topics. Each student will be assigned a member of staff as supervisor. Students will devise their own approach to researching and communicating their subject with advice from their supervisor. As part of their work they will be expected to address some of the specific aspects of their subject with the agreement of the supervisor. Students will be expected to work independently, to manage the direction of their work and to employ a significant component of self-directed learning.  Reflective practice: The student will keep a reflective journal of activity and produce an executive summary of that journal, summarising and communicating their reflective practice in relation to their project.  Transferable skills including time-management, presentation, communication, organisation, prioritisation and negotiation skills.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Having studied this module, students:  Will have formed a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of public engagement.    Subject-specific Skills:   In addition to the acquisition of subject knowledge, students:  Will be able to design and develop public engagement activities.  Will be able to communicate scientific concepts to a non-specialist audience.  Will have the skills to plan and carry out an extended project at an advanced level.  Will have demonstrated critical understanding of scientific background and pedagogical theories and practices.

Will have demonstrated the ability to develop and deliver a clear and engaging oral presentation on their work.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes a series of tutorials and the development and delivery of a project on a topic within Computer Science in the context of public engagement.  An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Computer Science, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.    One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.    Series of lectures on key transferable skills.    The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.    Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.    The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:    Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.    Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term. This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class. The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.    Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.    University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.    Special projects: The student will devise a special Computer Science project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with. The student will implement the special project and evaluate it. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.    Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils. The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.    Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.    The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.  Solutional methods for computational problems.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:   Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.

Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.  Will be able to improvise when necessary.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.    The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skils (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.    The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Computer Science education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.    The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.    The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their own personal development, on their experience of school and the organisation of teaching and on pupils' science learning, and to demonstrate written communication skills.    The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.    The Teacher's Assessment is an independent corroboration of progress, including the student's approach, attitude, appreciation of key educational skills and performance in the Special Project.

To provide experience of a research-led public engagement project in Chemistry.  To allow students to make an in-depth study of a particular topic in Chemistry, to undertake extensive independent research and to write at length on their chosen subject in the context of public engagement.  To develop a range of transferable skills in researching a topic in the context of public engagement and making oral and written presentations on their work.  To learn to devise and develop Chemistry projects and public engagement methods appropriate to the chosen topic and relevant audience(s).    Content  Project: A research-led public engagement project, set in collaboration with members of staff from the Department, and possibly with an external partner, allowing students to present the results of individual and independent work (note: an original contribution to scientific knowledge is not required or expected).  The student will implement and evaluate the project. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific public engagement problem and devise and develop an appropriate public engagement approach to address that specific problem.  Students will choose from a wide list of broad possible topics. Each student will be assigned a member of staff as supervisor. Students will devise their own approach to researching and communicating their subject with advice from their supervisor. As part of their work they will be expected to address some of the specific aspects of their subject with the agreement of the supervisor. Students will be expected to work independently, to manage the direction of their work and to employ a significant component of self-directed learning.  Reflective practice: The student will keep a reflective journal of activity and produce an executive summary of that journal, summarising and communicating their reflective practice in relation to their project.  Transferable skills including time-management, presentation, communication, organisation, prioritisation and negotiation skills.    Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Having studied this module, students:  Will have formed a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of public engagement.    Subject-specific Skills:   In addition to the acquisition of subject knowledge, students:  Will be able to design and develop public engagement activities.  Will be able to communicate scientific concepts to a non-specialist audience.  Will have the skills to plan and carry out an extended project at an advanced level.  Will have demonstrated critical understanding of scientific background and pedagogical theories and practices.    Key Skills:   Having studied this module, students:  Will be able to manage their time effectively.  Will be able to communicate effectively.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate effectively.  Will have demonstrated the ability to advance and extend their knowledge through significant independent learning and research.  Will have demonstrated the ability to produce a clear and detailed written report with appropriate presentation on their work.  Will have demonstrated the ability to engage in reflective practice and produce a clear and detailed piece of reflective writing with appropriate presentation, reflecting on their work.  Will have demonstrated the ability to develop and deliver a clear and engaging oral presentation on their work.    Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes a series of tutorials and the development and delivery of a project on a topic within Chemistry in the context of public engagement.  An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Chemistry, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Chemistry.     To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.    Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.     One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.     Series of lectures on key transferable skills.     The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.     Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.     The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:     Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.     Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term. This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class. The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.     Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.     University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.     Special projects: The student will devise a special Chemistry project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with. The student will implement the special project and evaluate it. The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.     Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils. The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.     Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.     The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.     Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:     Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.     Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of teaching in schools.     Will have an advanced understanding of Chemistry through having to explain to others.     Will have an advanced understanding of the problems of public perception of science.     Subject-specific Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will know the responsibilites and appropriate conduct for a teacher.     Will know how to give (and take) feedback on Chemistry issues.     Will be able to undertake public speaking on Chemistry generally.     Will know how to prepare lesson plans and teaching materials for Chemistry.     Key Skills:    On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to communicate effectively, both one to one and with small groups.     Will be able to understand the needs of individuals.    Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.     Will be able to improvise when necessary.     Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.     Will know how to work with others in teams.     Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.     The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skills (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.     The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Chemistry education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.     The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.     The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their own personal development, on their experience of school and the organisation of teaching and on pupils' science learning, and to demonstrate written communication skills.     The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.     The Teacher's Assessment is an independent corroboration of progress, including the student's approach, attitude, appreciation of key educational skills and performance in the Special Project.

An introductory tutorial will cover the structure of the project and will provide general advice on design and development, research methods, methods of presentation, etc.  A series of weekly tutorials will focus on key transferable skills and public engagement in Biosciences, and will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in public engagement in science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding alongside their own skills and ideas. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by arranging to meet with the module coordinators at other mutually convenient times.  Students will be expected to work in between the tutorials, and to discuss their own work during the tutorials. This work will be guided by the module co-ordinator, but will be organised by the students themselves, thereby enabling them to demonstrate their time management skills.  Students will undertake independent research to further their knowledge of the topic and self-directed learning to further their technical and transferable skills.  The tutorials also provide opportunities for module co-ordinators to monitor progress and to provide feedback and guidance on the development of ideas for the project, and for students to gauge their progress throughout the duration of the module.  Progress is further monitored by two formatively-assessed written documents: a project outline and an executive summary of a pilot journal, both submitted at the end of Term 1, providing further opportunities for feedback and for the students to gauge their progress.  Student performance will be summatively assessed through a written report on their project, a written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal, and an oral presentation. The written report will enable students to demonstrate their ability to communicate an advanced scientific topic in the context of public engagement clearly and with appropriate presentation. The written reflective journal and executive summary of that journal will enable the students to demonstrate their ability to engage in reflective practice and communicate that reflection clearly and with appropriate presentation. The oral presentation will enable students to demonstrate their oral communication skills. Both the written report on their special project and the oral presentation assessment components will enable students to demonstrate a detailed appreciation of the science related to a particular topic.

To help inspire a new generation of Bioscientists as prospective undergraduates by providing role models for school pupils.  To help teachers convey the excitement of their subject to pupils by showing them the long-term applications of school studies, especially the cross disciplinary relationships of Biosciences.To help teachers by providing an assistant who can work with and support pupils at any point on the ability spectrum.  Content  A competitive interview system will be used to match students with appropriate schools and a specific teacher in the local area, and each student selected will be given a chance to visit the school they will be working in before commencement of the placement.  One day training course on working in schools and with pupils.  Series of lectures on key transferable skills.  The student will be required to spend half a day (approx 4hrs) a week in the school every week for at least 10 weeks.  Tutorials which will provide an opportunity for students to share their experiences.  The students will be involved in the following activities in support of their learning and teaching:  Classroom observation and assistance: Initial contact with the teacher and pupils will be as a classroom assistant, watching how the teacher handles the class, observing the level being taught and the structure of the lesson, and offering practical support to the teacher.  Teaching assistance: The teacher will assign the student with actual teaching tasks, which will vary dependent on specific needs and the student's own ability as it develops over the term.  This could include for example offering problem-solving coaching to a smaller group of higher ability pupils, or taking the last ten minutes of the lesson for the whole class.  The student will have to demonstrate an understanding of how the level of the knowledge of the pupils they are teaching fits in to their overall learning context in other subjects.  Whole class teaching: Students will typically be offered, in collaboration with their teachers, at least one opportunity to undertake whole class teaching, albeit that it may be only for a small part of the lesson.  University awareness: Students will represent and promote their academic discipline as a potential university choice to pupils across the social and academic range represented at their partner schools.  Special projects: The student will devise a special Biosciences project on the basis of discussion with the teacher and module co-ordinator and their own assessment of what will interest the particular pupils they are working with.  The student will implement the special project and evaluate it.  The student will be required to show that they can analyse a specific teaching problem and devise and prepare appropriately targeted teaching materials, practical demonstrations and basis 'tests' where appropriate.  Extra-curricular projects: The student may be supervised by the teacher in helping to run an out-of-timetable activity, such as a lunchtime club or special coaching periods for higher ability pupils.  The student will have to demonstrate an ability to think laterally in order to formulate interesting ways to illustrate more difficult scientific concepts.  Written reports: The student will keep a journal of their own progress in working in the classroom environment, and they will be asked to prepare a written report on the special project.  The teachers will act as the main source of guidance in the schools but, in addition, the students will also be able to discuss progress with the module co-ordinator or a member of the Science Outreach Team whenever necessary.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to assess and devise appropriate ways to communicate a difficult principle or concept.  Will have gained a broad understanding of many of the key aspects of teaching in schools.  Will have an advanced understanding of Biosciences through having to explain to others.  Will have an advanced understanding of the problems of public perception of science.  Subject-specific Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will know the responsibilites and appropriate conduct for a teacher.  Will know how to give (and take) feedback on Biosciences issues.  Will be able to undertake public speaking on Biosciences generally.  Will know how to prepare lesson plans and teaching materials for Biosciences.  Key Skills:   On successful completion of this module students:  Will be able to communicate effectively, both one to one and with small groups.  Will be able to understand the needs of individuals.  Will be able to use interpersonal skills when dealing with colleagues.  Will be able to improvise when necessary.  Will be able to organise, prioritise and negotiate.  Will know how to work with others in teams.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  This module includes an initial training course, lectures, tutorials and a school placement.  The initial training course provides an introduction to working in schools and with pupils. The lectures provide the means to give a concise, focused presentation on generic aspects of key transferable skils (e.g. teaching and learning skills and presentation skills). The lecture material will be explicitly linked to scenarios that are likely to arise in the school placement. When appropriate, the lectures will also be supported by the distribution of written material, or by information and relevant links on DUO.  The tutorials will provide opportunity for students to share their experiences and to discuss specific issues in Biosciences education and the public perception of science, giving them the chance to develop their theoretical understanding and communication skills. Students will be able to obtain further help in their studies by approaching the course leaders, either after lectures or tutorials or at other mutually convenient times.  The school placement allows the student to develop a range of interpersonal skills and the professional competencies expected of an effective teacher (or a facilitator to others), thus ensuring that the learning outcomes are met. Student performance will be summatively assessed through a Journal of Teaching Activity, an End of Module Report, an End of Module Presentation and a Teacher's Assessment.  The Journal of Teaching Activity and End of Module Report will provide the means for students to reflect on their own personal development, on their experience of school and the organisation of teaching and on pupils' science learning, and to demonstrate written communication skills.  The End of Module Presentation will enable students to give a practical demonstration of teaching competencies including oral communication skills.  The Teacher's Assessment is an independent corroboration of progress, including the student's approach, attitude, appreciation of key educational skills and performance in the Special Project.

Excluded Combination of Modules  None.  Aims  The module aims to develop students' knowledge and understanding of key issues related to the gig economy, new work practices and more generally the future of work.    The module, in particular, sets out to foster analytical reflections on the origin and growth of the gig economy including coworking, digital nomadism, platform work.  This involves exploring what lies behind current manifestations of the gig economy, including coworking, digital nomadism and platform work.     This module seeks to provide students with a critical appreciation of the gig economy and the future of work through a focus on key concepts, including power, control, autonomy, flexibility, etc.    Content  The module will start by considering the relation between the 'so-called' old and new worlds of work in order to flesh out both continuities and discontinuities.  This will be an opportunity to unpack what lies behind the term 'new' with regards to work practices.  This will be followed by a detailed examination of how the gig economy operates (i.e. its logic, main systems, economic rationale, etc.).  The module will then analyse recent developments in the gig economy through the concepts of language, power and control.  These three concepts will play a key role in this module, as they will form the basis of a critical evaluation of the gig economy.  This will be followed by an in-depth exploration of the four key dimensions seen at the heart of the gig economy, namely collaboration, independence, flexibility and mobility.  These will be analysed through the aforementioned concepts (language, power and control) and illustrated through current phenomena encountered in the new world of work (e.g. coworking spaces, platform work, digital nomadism).  Finally, the module will consider the relation between the gig economy and formal organisations and reflect over what the future of work might look like.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Contextualise and make sense of current discussions on the work of world and critically assess the main trends connected to the future of work.  Appreciate and be familiar with a range of theoretical perspectives for understanding changes happening to the world of work and organisations in general  Understand the role of language, power and control in current manifestations of the gig economy.  Reflect on the relations between individuals, organisations and society.  Subject-specific Skills:   Critcally reflect on the development of the gig economy and what it might tell us about the future of work  Apply critical thinking to contemporary work issues  Understand the role of micro, macro and meso forces in the shaping of work activities  Key Skills:   Critical thinking and analysis  Interpersonal and teamworking skills  Oral presentation skills  Ability of communicate effectively in writing on specialised subject areas  Time management  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Learning will occur through preparation and attendance at lectures and seminars, together with private self-directed study    Seminar classes will provide a series of structured activities (including case/journal article analysis and group exercises) in order to provide support, reinforce knowledge and encourage independent private study.    Formative assessment will involve drafting a structured plan (max 2 pages) of the answer to the summative assignment. This will help students with their summative assignment.    Summative assessment will involve a 20-minute group presentation to take place in the final seminar of the term as well as a 3000-word individual piece of work. The group presentation will be based around the reading and critical analysis of a research paper on new ways of working. The 3000-word individual piece of work will involve drawing from concepts and theories (studied in the lectures) as well as empirical examples (explored during the lectures and seminars) to address a question on the gig economy. Both assignments will test the depth and breadth of students' analytical skills, together with their conceptual and empirical understanding of the gig economy.

Location  Durham   Prerequisites  None  Corequisites  None  Excluded Combination of Modules  None  Aims  The primary aim of this module is to introduce to students the notion of the practice of entrepreneurship, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, with particular emphasis on the extent to which this understanding relates to the practical processes of new business start-up and growth (including social enterprises). We will consider global citizenship, environmental stewardship, social justice and global inequalities, ethics (including ethical investment strategies) and sustainable leadership in the context of an entrepreneurial mindset.  This module will introduce students to the key aspects of the process of new venture creation. This module guides students through the stages of new venture creation - including the creative process at the 'ideas' stage, and the entrepreneurially distinct requirements in terms of marketing, finance, human resources, operation management etc. The distinction between 'entrepreneurial' and 'management' approaches will be clearly drawn. It will then confront students with the enterprise skills and outlooks/aptitudes associated with starting up and running a new venture for personal, environmental and sustainable gain.   Finally, using a formative group video and an individual summative personal business plan as an action framework, the module provides  students with the opportunity to carry out key preparatory tasks required for business start-up with consideration of ethical business practice incorporated into the plan.  Content  The following list of topics is indicative and will be tailored to the specific business concepts students choose to develop under the team's guidance:  The entrepreneurial process and new venture creation.    Skills for entrepreneurship including ethical and social benefits of entrepreneurial practice.  Entrepreneurial types and their role within the commercial, social and global economy.  Creativity, innovation and idea generation    The opportunity business model.  Competitors - social, commercial and public sector competitors included - and the external environment (market, regulation, policy etc.)    Strategies for survival via sustainable competitiveness and social benefits.  Entrepreneurial marketing.  Entrepreneurial finance - forms of financial support     Business accounting for new ventures - projecting interpreting financial performance.

Be able to demonstrate the skills and aptitudes associated with entrepreneurship in a variety of contexts including social entrepreneurship, commercial entrepreneurship and the ethical issues attendant upon both these approaches, and the new venture creation process.  Understand the critical aspects of starting and operating a business, including the role of business functions and their interrelationships in the process of new business start-up  Be able to demonstrate their understanding of the complex (and dynamic) processes of business start-up (eg. marketing, operations, finance and human resource management) and reflect their understanding  Be able to research, compile and present a realistic business plan, suitable for a potential investment audience, to the standards expected of a new graduate seeking to engage in business start-up activities.  Subject-specific Skills:   Upon successful completion of the module, students will:    Conduct in-depth research into developing a business idea.  Present and defend a new business idea.    Construct a realistic business plan and understand its purpose.    Understand what is distinctive in entrepreneurial behaviour.  Develop team-building and project management skills.  Key Skills:   Audio-visual presentation skills, including the soft skills required when pitching of a business idea to an investment audience  Presentation skills, including pitching of a business idea    Written communication skills.    Planning and organising skills - developed through team project and development of individual business plans.  Teamworking/management skills - used in seminars and formative assessment.  Problem solving and analytical skills - including in summative project stage.  Computer literacy e.g. in data search, class presentation, case study search and design/content of business plan.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Learning outcomes will be met through a combination of lectures, group work, video making, case studies (including talks/videos by entrepreneurs) and discussion, supported by guided reading. The emphasis throughout will be on integrating theory with practice. The workshops (and to an extent the formal lectures) will be interactive with class participants being involved in individual and group activities to encourage critical and creative thinking regarding the active nature of entrepreneurship (drawing from effectuation approaches). Students will be expected to undertake their own research to develop and supplement the material covered in the sessions and to conduct secondary research in their chosen business idea. The formative group presentation (which will require the students to present a business idea in the form of a short video) and the written summative assignment (involving an individual business plan/case) will assess understanding of relevant concepts and students' ability to apply what they have learned to construct a feasible business plan. Students will also be given the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the Business School and University enterprise competitions, individually or in teams, to gain further experience (e.g. of pitching a business idea).

Practical classes during Term One provide exposure to academic and commercial consumer research, and supervised instruction in designing and conducting consumer psychology experiments.  Tutorials during Term Two provide ongoing supervision during the design and execution of a substantive independent research project.   The module culminates in presentation of the research project during a mini-conference held at the end of Term Two.    Formative assessment is in two forms: evaluation of, and feedback on, work undertaken during the practical classes; and through feedback on the preparation of the project outline, draft chapter, tutorial discussions, and the maintenance of an individual project diary.    Summative assessment is in three parts. The first component is a research proposal submitted at the end of the block of practical classes, outlining the intended project to be undertaken during Term Two.  Students present their findings at a summatively-assessed mini-conference held at the end of Term Two which evaluates skills in the dissemination and communication of key research findings to a diverse audience.  The main element of the summative assessment is the Practical Project Report, assessed as a scientific report conforming to a journal style and requiring students to demonstrate their evaluative, analytical and research skills in a single comprehensive piece of work.

Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Teaching is by lectures and seminars. Learning takes place through attendance at lectures, reading (which will be recommended at the end of each lecture session), preparation for and participation in seminars, and independent study.    Students are expected to read and make additional notes on each subject delivered throughout the module with directed reading suggestions at the end of each lecture, but also through additional reading based on students self-motivation.     Seminars will consist of examining case examples of strategies management in practice and questions, exercises and debates will be used to support and reinforce knowledge as well as encouraging further study. Students are expected, with no exception, to take full part in discussions within the seminar setting.    Formative assessment will be by means of students developing a positioning document that includes an outline and plan of the summative coursework assignment (up to a maximum of 1000 words).

Each week in the first term, students will work together in small teams to manage competing brands within a specific product market. In the simulated real-time environment, students will learn to understand the customer, analyse the market structure and competition, set marketing strategy, implement tactical marketing decisions and ultimately, compete with other teams to win market share. As a team, students are required to agree and input their marketing decisions into the simulation. Preparation for each element of the simulation takes place as independent, group-based working. The second term will develop skills in the preparation of a marketing plan for a real (currently operating) organisation.  Assessment will be based on both the simulation and the marketing plan.    The module will be taught in 2 hour blocks and will focus on (a) reviewing and discussing the output from the previous element of the simulation/marketing plan and (b) identifying the relevant theoretical foundations which will enable to students to participate effectively in the next element of the simulation/plan. This gives students time for both reflection and appropriate conceptual understanding.     Through immersion in a virtual professional setting, students will be able to appreciate how theory relates to practice and how to apply it effectively. In addition, they will be required to reflect on the consequences of their decisions and decision-making processes both individually and in teams.

This delivery format is comprised of three main elements. Traditional lectures provide the theoretical building blocks of the module, along with opportunities for interaction and Q&A input from the Module Leader. Between each lecture, students work through a series of asynchronous online learning materials consisting of podcasts/videos, self-directed quizzes to check learning progress, peer discussion topics and a series of online behavioural science experiments that would not be possible to undertake within a traditional classroom setting.  Finally, in order to consolidate learning and to refine the skills required for the summative project, students participate in two substantive practical classes during the course of the term in which they design and conduct live experiments under the supervision of the Module Leader .  The module is assessed by means of a Practical Project, work on which is ongoing throughout the term and supported by the practical classes.  Students identify a specific marketing problem and design, conduct and report on an approved topic, making marketing recommendations for the target brand. The project must be grounded in appropriate academic literature critically engaged with during the course of the module too.

To provide students with tools, knowledge and skills for managing strategy in future employment.     Content  This module will focus on strategic management and key subjects in this domain as well as addressing more contemporary theories and topics of strategy. It will also provide an opportunity for students to apply conceptual and theoretical knowledge into practice with the help of a Strategy Simulation. This module will take a critical perspective on the subject matter with alternate and often contrasting perspectives on subjects provided to students to reinforce the central messages of this module that (1) strategy and strategic management are essential; (2) there is no one best way of developing strategy or conducting strategic management, and; (3) key ideas and concepts within strategy can be contentious and require addressing and balancing for success.   Indicative content covered in this module include:     Definitions and explanations of the nature of strategy and strategic management.     The strategic management process (deliberate vs emergent strategy; planning vs improvisation).    Strategy-making: the tools of strategic analysis, internal and external analyses, developing strategic options including warfare strategies.     Implementation.     Strategic thinking and learning.     Competition and strategic positioning.     Competitive advantage.     Failure.     International strategic management.     Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   Demonstrate a deep and critical understanding of strategic management and the associated literature     Have developed a critical understanding of the factors influencing business strategies.     Comprehend the multiple different perspectives and approaches to strategy.     Develop understanding of a range of theoretical frameworks for analysing of strategy.     Explore the nature of strategy, competition and success.     Understand the nature of failure and how to strategically manage such situations.     Understand complications and challenges faced in international strategic management.     Subject-specific Skills:   Be able to apply relevant analytical tools and frameworks to assess environments, strategies and strategic options.     Understand, and be able to apply, the concepts and theories of strategic management to practice.     Be able to locate, comprehend and critically evaluate relevant research and sources of information relating to strategic management.

Develop cohesive and persuasive arguments.     Research appropriate periodicals, books, websites and other references to extract and draw together information and knowledge.     Research companies and draw out meaningful knowledge and conclusions from various information sources (e.g., from financial statements, Annual Reports, analysts reports).     Effective written communication, for instance in terms of analysis of strategic issues, report writing and delivering effective critique.    Cooperative learning.  Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  Teaching is by Lectures and practical workshops. Learning takes place through attendance at lectures, reading (which will be recommended at the end of each lecture session), preparation for and participation in Workshops and independent study.     Students are expected to read and make additional notes on each subject delivered throughout the module with directed reading suggestions at the end of each lecture, but also through additional reading based on students self-motivation.     Workshops will consist of a Strategy Simulation exercise where students will be organised into small groups or senior management teams responsible for running a company in a simulated environment.  These practical workshops will be used to support and reinforce knowledge as well as encouraging further study.  Students are expected, with no exception, to take full part in the workshop activities.     Formative assessment will be by means of student group presentation of an external environment and industry analysis where their company will be positioned during the Simulation exercise.  Verbal feedback will be provided to each individual group after their presentation, which can then be built upon and developed for the summative coursework assignment. Students will also receive ongoing and continuous feedback on decisions taken throughout the Simulation via the software itself.   The summative assessments will provide a test of the understanding and analytical skills acquired by students. As part of the summative coursework assignment, students will be expected to analyse, in detail, the strategy and business results of the company they were managing during the Simulation in the form of an individual report. The word limit is set at a maximum of 3500 words. The summative assessment will require students to think critically, be able to analyse, evaluate and then apply concepts and theories taught during the module in their assessments. Students will be expected to apply their own research skills and reflecting on their Simulation learning experience and also use their own initiative to develop insights into strategy.

Excluded Combination of Modules  None  Aims  This module is designed to enable students to understand the key principles of marketing theory and its application in both commercial and non-commercial sectors.    This module also aims to provide an introduction to marketing practices, where students will begin to appreciate a critical engagement with relevant academic research and case study material. We will go beyond the sole interest of developing knowledge that enables marketing practitioners to maximise the sales of products and services. Students will critically assess marketing principles and concepts in order to develop criticial thinking in Marketing and a deeper engagement with Marketing studies. As such the module will provide a foundation for further study, and expose students to marketing concepts through the application of case studies as well as up-to-date academic research and practice.    The module also aims to provide students with an understanding of how marketing works in practice, taking into account the context (domestic or international), culture, market characteristics and trends.    Content  An introduction to the study and practice of marketing   Consumer behaviour and decision-making  Managing marketing: marketing strategy and planning; segmentation, targetting and positioning; the development of marketing - both academically and professionally; branding; the marketing of products, services and experiences.

Seminars  (S) will allow students to experience a broader range of thinking on a topic, and to interact with associated subject experts. They will provide an opportunity for smaller-group discussion and exploration of selected topics in greater depth.  They may include case studies and presentations and are intended to develop students discursive and interpersonal skills. They will also be used as a focus for student-led material to be provided to the module cohort.      Independent study (IS), research and analysis underpin students written and presented work and develop their ability to think independently, discriminate and use judgment, and assess the relevance and validity of others views.      Structured reading (SR), in conjunction with lectures, underpins the knowledge requirements of the programme.       Case studies (CS) provide students with an opportunity to consider and apply what they have learnt in the context of a particular example.  They are intended to develop students analytical skills.      Reports (R) (whether in written examinations or as assessed coursework) develop students ability to communicate clearly, in writing, a coherent argument based on relevant subject-specific knowledge under constraints of length and/or time and (in the case of written examinations) without access to study aids.      Group presentations (GP) provide students with an opportunity to consider and apply what they have learnt in the context of a particular issue or problem.  They are intended to develop students analytical, presentational and interpersonal skills, including working with others.  The summative assessment is in two parts; an individual assignment of 2500 words, and a group presentation.

Content  Game Theory is the systematic study of strategic interactions that are present everywhere, not only in economics but in politics, sociology, law, computer science, and sports.  This module will mainly cover an introduction to the tools of game theory with an emphasis on its application to real life problems. Topics will be drawn primarily from the following:  Introduction to game theory:  The first part of the module will develop the necessary tools to resolve conflicts in real life problems where economic agents strategise to improve their prospects. The module will consider Nash equilibrium as a solution concept and elaborate on its refinements. Then, it will cover four types of fundamental games: games of perfect and incomplete information, static and dynamic games. Finally, we will introduce cooperative games.     Applications:  After an introduction to fundamentals of game theory, the module will apply the tools acquired in the first part to propose a resolution in several real life problems: bargaining, auctions, market design, mechanism design and resource allocation.  Learning Outcomes Subject-specific Knowledge:   At the conclusion of the module students should:  be able to interpret scholarly articles that pursue a game theoretic approach;    have explored, understood and appreciated the complexity and contradictions of the relevant academic literature and be able to identify their own research questions.     Subject-specific Skills:   At the end of this module, students should:  be able to conduct game theoretic analysis for the resolution of practical problems driven by strategic behaviour;    be able to comment on the design of markets and private and public policies at local, national and international level, informed by the knowledge of game theory acquired in the module.    Key Skills:   Written Communication;    Planning, Organising and Time Management;    Problem Solving and analysis by applying game theory knowledge;   Using Initiative;   Numeracy.

In-class training (delivered while students are in employment) will develop studentsâ€™ ability to adopt innovative approaches to mitigate these risks and challenges.    Additional experiential learning throughout the module, which will be recorded in a professional practice diary as part of the formative assessment, will help to cement the links between the theory and concepts of the audit profession and professional practice.    Reflecting the links between theory and practice which underpin this module, the summative assessment takes the form of a professional practice portfolio and critical reflection.  This will assess studentsâ€™ understanding of the main body of audit theories and concepts and their application in a professional workplace environment. It will therefore encompass a range of issues and scenarios issues in relation to audit profession methodologies and clientsâ€™ entities and environment; studentsâ€™ their theoretical and conceptual understanding of the professional practice; and their ability to apply these theories and concepts in the workplace in an innovative way to assist the audit profession in mitigating business and audit risks and challenges.     The portfolio itself will require students to integrate academic and professional methodology, evidencing the different safeguards and procedures being followed in specific circumstances to avoid threats or mitigate audit risks.  It will also require them to reflect upon and critically discuss their observations and evidence, and to explore any limitations or drawbacks of the audit practices, procedures and standards applied, whether from a practical or a regulatory perspective.

Subject-specific Skills:   At the end of the mdoule students should be able to:  be able to design and conduct initial research and investigation.  understand the relation of positivist and interpretive frameworks.    be able to select appropriate methods and conduct initial analyses of data using basic statistical, mathematical and qualitative techniques.    be able to report on the process, outcomes and implications of a business investigation.    Key Skills:   Ability to access data and information from a range of sources.     Ability to analyse and present basic quantitative and qualitative data.     Written communication.     Time management.     Modes of Teaching, Learning and Assessment and how these contribute tothe learning outcomes of the module  The central learning approach involves students taking an active role in learning, practising and developing the skills and approaches that make up the majority of the module content. The frameworks for these competences will be presented in lectures, through directed reading and by direction to other materials e.g. DUO.   Preparation for and participation in workshop and seminar sessions will provide opportunities for students to analyse their current abilities, knowledge and preferences and to apply these to small-scale investigations, simulations and group and individual activities. These will then be developed and extended in active research and fieldwork.  The module will also integrate closely with other level 1 modules. Skills and knowledge developed in this module will provide the bases for further enquiry, learning and practice in the other first year modules.  In turn, the knowledge base from those modules will also be called on to inform and contextualise the development of skills and competences within this module. The timing of specific areas of learning will be designed in to the module so as to enhance these learning opportunities. Regular feedback from workshops and seminars along with that from specific formative assignment(s) will provide information to students on their progress.       The summative assessments build skills and knowledge. Part one focuses on a team based project in which students are required to work together to observe an aspect of everyday working and analyse it in relation to that yearâ€™s key module theme (e.g. rationalisation, or anomie, or power, or innovation...). This is then incorporated into a summatively assessed YouTube Presentation for which all students in a group receive the same mark. Extending the analytical and observational skills gained in term 1; term 2 requires that students work individually to interview one worker and one manager within a single work context. Building on their newly acquired interviewing and listening skills students construct accounts of varying perspectives on organising and relate it to the literature. This is supplemented by a reflexive account. The teaching and assessments are designed to be constructively aligned so that well directed effort during the terms is rewarded through performance in assessment. These assessment components will ensure that the learning outcomes are addressed.
