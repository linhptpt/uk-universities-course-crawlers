The course divides equally between the theoretical and finite element approaches.  The theoretical part of the course uses the theory of elasticity to determine elastic stress fields in idealised solids using both the stress function approach and a first principles equilibrium approach.  The FE part (as well as recapping relevant FE theory) takes a decidedly practical and industry-orientated approach to solving 2D and 3D stress analysis problems and focuses on the steps a practicing FE engineer would follow in solving various types of problems.  The FE work beings with idealised geometries were results are compared with theory and progresses towards more complex problems, which are not amenable to theoretical treatment.

A key objective is to illustrate the problems created by non-functional requirements - where it is impossible to ever be entirely safe no matter how much resources are used in the development of complex software.  From this we aim to motivate the use of analysis and development techniques to convince other engineers (regulators, customers) that systems are acceptably safe to operate.   We aim to provide an understanding both of the techniques already used in industry and also of research methods being developed across many different industries including aviation, space, rail, healthcare and the military Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of this course students will be able to: 1.  Discuss the professional and social issues involved in the design and testing of safety- critical systems; 2.  Discuss the importance of standards and show a clear understanding of recent initiatives in  this area; 3.  Apply a number of risk analysis techniques such as Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality  Analysis and Fault Tree Analysis; 4.  Apply a number of safety critical design techniques such as redundancy; 5.  Apply a number of safety critical evaluation techniques such as Black Box testing; 6.  Identify the main characteristics of an appropriate safety culture within large organisations; 7.  Identify key trends in recent research into safety critical systems development; 8.  Relate research in 7. To wider concerns both in the development of critical national infrastructures and also cyber-security.

Course Aims The many   core revolution means that almost all  hardware platforms contain  multiple cores , and that the architectures evolve rapidly as the number of cores increases.    Software on such platforms  must be     Scalable:  emergent computing platforms operate at unprecedented scale, with commodity servers already commonly comprising hundreds of hosts, tens of thousands of cores, and thousands of storage devices.  The trend towards large distributed systems is driven by Moore's law and is powering transformative developments in areas like sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and big data infrastructures and analytics.    Reliable:  systems must tolerate and recover from hardware, software and network failures.   Moreover the semantics of highly concurrent and fault tolerant systems is complex, and specialised techniques are required to reasoning about these systems so as to be confident that they are reliable in the sense of being correct.     This course aims to provide both a broad overview of emerging technologies for engineering reliable and scalable systems, together with practical experience using a small number of key technologies for designing, implementing and evaluating scalable parallel systems and reliable distributed systems.

Course Aims The many   core revolution means that almost all  hardware platforms contain  multiple cores , and that the architectures evolve rapidly as the number of cores increases.    Software on such platforms  must be     Scalable:  emergent computing platforms operate at unprecedented scale, with commodity servers already commonly comprising hundreds of hosts, tens of thousands of cores, and thousands of storage devices.  The trend towards large distributed systems is driven by Moore's law and is powering transformative developments in areas like sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and big data infrastructures and analytics.    Reliable:  systems must tolerate and recover from hardware, software and network failures.   Moreover the semantics of highly concurrent and fault tolerant systems is complex, and specialised techniques are required to reasoning about these systems so as to be confident that they are reliable in the sense of being correct.     This course aims to provide both a broad overview of emerging technologies for engineering reliable and scalable systems, together with practical experience using a small number of key technologies for designing, implementing and evaluating scalable parallel systems and reliable distributed systems.

In particular, this course will provide students with a solid and thorough understanding of the theoretical principles of financial markets. At the same time, attention will be given to the empirical observations and practical relevance of the theories introduced. The course will study  the links between investment and returns and will also investigate consumption and investment choices under uncertainty.  It is  organised around several important themes; however, the central theme is Portfolio Manage ment and Optimisation. This includes optimal securities and weights selection, construction of the efficient portfolio frontier, deriving the Tangency and GMVP portfolios, examine various portfolio strategies and finally analyse the benefits of diversifica tion. The second  and equally important  theme of this c ourse is related to models and theories of asset pricing. This includes an analytical derivation of CAPM and an introduction to APT and Multifactor Models. In this framework, EMH and its different versions will be explained, while its effects on financial markets will be discussed. The last theme of this course introduces students to pricing of Fixed Income Securities. This includes and analysis of bond pricing and yields, the role of default risk on bond pricing, and finally a discussion of the term structure of interest rates and some related theories.

Main Assessment In:  December Course Aims The  course provides students with a  deep  understanding of the functioning of financial markets, combining theoretical foundations with empirical evidence.  Students will  investigate economic behaviour under uncertainty, such as investment, savings and consumpti on  decisions , with and without financial markets.  They will also be able to   understand and  analyse   current approaches used by financial analysts to calculate the fair value of assets and  identify  lucrative trading opportunities  based on the foundations of the  Capital Asset Pricing M odel  (CAPM)  and other Multifactor Models. The important question,  whether it is possible to ""beat the market""  or not ,  will be addressed through  a review of the theoretical arguments and the empirical  evidence concerning the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Furthermore,  the underlying principles and  functioning of  different  asset pricing models  will be studied ,  also  considering  many financial stylized facts such as calendar anomalies, momentum and liq uidity effects. Finally, the course  aims  to  i nvestigat e   how f ixed income securities  are priced , the quantification of   credit /default  risk and the management of Bond Portfolios. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By  the end of the course, students should be able to:   1.  Understand the important link between investment risk and expected return, as well as their determinants.    2.

In particular, it will deal with the issues of  both accidental and intentional threat actors through a consideration of  human error (slips, lapses, mistakes) and violations (accidental and intentional) . It will then  frame those issues within the context of systems failure and the provision of security within safety critical organisations. Timetable The course is delivered over 3 full days. As part of the learning design for this course, it was structured for a blended (student-centred) form of delivery and has been redeveloped for online delivery (asynchronous) but with some online, face-to-face sessions. Requirements of Entry Please refer to the current postgraduate prospectus at:  http://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/ Excluded Courses None Co-requisites None Assessment There will be team-based essay/report of 4,500 words (Max) which will allow for an assessment of ILOs 1- 5 . During the course, the teams take the role of being security/human factors specialists who are attempting to explain the vulnerabilities within an organisation's mission critical systems to a senior manager/board who is resistant to accepting those assessments. They will work in those teams throughout the course.  The assessment will be presented in the form of a report written by students working in their teams and will have two components.  · The main body of the report will be allocated 70% of the overall grade. This report will be submitted to the school office and then sent to a peer group from the course for critique.  · Each group will have their draft essay/report reviewed by another team to provide a structured, formative peer critique. This critique is a compulsory (but unmarked) requirement of the assessment.  · The peer review comments will be sent back to the authoring group who will respond to those comments in a reflexive response. This response will account for the remaining 30% of the potential marks to be awarded. The response to the critique will be a maximum of 1500 words. This response (along with the peer critique) will then be formally submitted for assessment. Are reassessment opportunities available for all summative assessments?  No Reassessments are normally available for all courses, except those which contribute to the Honours classification.  For non-Honours courses, students are offered reassessment in all or any of the components of assessment if the satisfactory (threshold) grade for the overall course is not achieved at the first attempt. This is normally grade D3 for undergraduate students and grade C3 for postgraduate students. Exceptionally it may not be possible to offer reassessment of some coursework items, in which case the mark achieved at the first attempt will be counted towards the final course grade. Course Aims The course will offer an overview of  the processes around the provision of safety and security and do so from a human factors  (Ergonomics)  perspective.  The course considers the role played by intentional and accidental threat actors in the generation of security failures and it  will have  a particular focus on the  role that systems  complexity  can play in generating emergent conditions which can exceed the abilities of human actors to manage them. The course aims to highlight the role that human agency can play in the embedding of error and violation potential within organisational systems, that can create the conditions in which staff are caught in error and violation traps . These will    ultimately erode the  security  controls that are put in place to prevent systems failure.   Participants will be introduced to a range of tools, techniques and practices which are commonly used  within organisations to address the issues of security and safety in socio-technical systems. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of this course students will be able to:  1.  Identify, contextualise and critique the processes that lead to the development of error and violation potential within organisational processes from both latent and active conditions and be able to research and develop a threat matrix for an organisation that they are familiar with, showing how vulnerabilities in both operational processes and security systems can be embedded and exposed. This will require the analysis and critique of an organisation's current security and human factors strategies using a range of appropriate tools and techniques around the identification of vulnerabilities. 2.  Develop and evaluate a range of design options around the introduction of a security system for an organisation and highlight the potential for errors and violations within that design. 3.  Evaluate and discuss the potential for threat actors to cause harm within organisations either through acts of commission or omission and proposed reasoned and robust defences to deal with those threats. 4.  Show an understanding of the challenges of working within multi-disciplinary teams to address security vulnerabilities and develop coping strategies to deal with those challenges in a practical context 5.

Contemporary macroeconomic theory is used to define what is achievable through monetary policy. The course then considers the instruments available to the monetary authorities to achieve these aims, and assesses the relative merits of these approaches to the implementation of monetary policy. In doing so, we also explore the use of unconventional monetary policies following the financial crisis. Next we examine the monetary transmission mechanism. The course concludes by looking at issues in the design of optimal monetary policy institutions, at the time-inconsistency problem and at the desirability of inflation targeting and/or an independent central bank.

It concentrates on setting out the essential building blocks of modern macroeconomic theory by covering: the theory of firms and long-run growth; the theory of households and asset pricing; economic inequality at the macro-economic level; and household heterogeneity and the link between aggregate outcomes and inequality. The unifying approach adopted throughout is based on the principles that households maximise utility subject to their budget constraints; firms maximise profits subject to the demand for their product and costs of production; and prices adjust such that an equilibrium exists and markets clear. Finally, macroeconomic economic data will be introduced and discussed to help students to understand and assess the predictions of the theory. Timetable One 2-hour lecture per week for 10 weeks. One 90 minute revision lecture before the degree exam.

The project is a systematic exploration of a global business issue; it requires using academic frameworks and apply tools & theories covered in the MGB programme to enhance understanding of a global business issue.  It allows them to critically select, evaluate and apply programme theories, concepts and ideas to their research problem and to  asses  the relevance of these to their research and/or business context.  The global business issue can originate in the academic literature (for which a Dissertation is delivered) or in business practice (for which an Internship Report is delivered).  Irrespective of the origin of the research problem, the same criteria will be applied to test student's ability to derive generally-relevant insights and knowledge based on a specific global business issue. Timetable The global research project is typically is typically carried out through the winter months, between late September and mid-November. It is supported via regular individual and collective supervisory meetings, including 4 pre-scheduled supervisory sessions.  A 5-hour preparatory lecture will be delivered by the relevant programme coordinators towards the end of the third semester (April-June) to explain aims and learning objectives, supervisory arrangements and key deadlines.

In  particular, it will deal with the issues of human error (slips, lapses, mistakes) and violations (accidental and intentional) and frame those issues within the context of systems failure and the provision of security within safety critical organisations. Timetable The course is delivered over 3 full days, comprising of 15 hours of lectures and 6 hours of seminars. Requirements of Entry Registration on the MSc Financial Technology programme Excluded Courses None Co-requisites None Assessment Students will be expected to work on a real-world case to assess  the potential human factors' elements associated with potential vulnerabilities around elements of either systems failure, security weakness, or the generation of strategic errors within process design.    There will be an individual essay of 3000 words fo cusing on ILOs 1, 4 and 5.  The essay will be presented in the form of a dialogue between a security/human factors specialist who is attempting to explain the vulnerabilities within the organisations mission critical systems and a senior manager who is res istant to accepting those assessments. Course Aims The course will offer an overview of  the processes around the provision of safety and security and do so from a human factors perspective. The course will have  a  particular focus  on the  role that systems  complexity   can play in generating  emergent conditions which can exceed the abili ties of human actors to manage them. The course aims to highlight the role that human agency can play in the embedding of error and violation potential within organisational systems, that can create the conditions in which staff are caught in error and vio lation traps,  and which can ultimately erode the controls that are put in place to prevent systems failure.   Participants will be introduced to a range of tools, techniques and practices which are commonly used  within organisations to address the issues o f security and safety in socio-technical systems. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of this course students will be able to:   1.  Identify, contextualise and critique the processes that lead  to the development of error and violation potential within organisational processes. 2.  Be able to research and develop a threat matrix for an organisation that they are familiar with, showing how vulnerabilities in both operational processes and security sy stems can be embedded and exposed. 3.   Analyse and critique an organisation's current security and human factors strategies using a range of appropriate tools and techniques around the identification of vulnerabilities  4.   Develop and evaluate a range of design options around the introduction of a security system for an organisation and highlight the potential for errors and violations within that design. 5.  Evaluate and discuss the potential for threat actors to cause harm wi thin organisations either through acts of commission or omission and proposed reasoned and robust defences to deal with those threats. 6.

The in ‐ course assessment takes the form of two group presentations.  2.  Each presentation is worth 12.5% of the overall course grade. 3.  For each presentation, students will be given a topic to prepare within  their  group. The presentation will be expected to last 10-15  minutes, with a further 10-15 minutes of questions from the examiners. 4.  All students are expected to contribute to both presentations.   Groupwork Process 1.  The assessment is group-based first because by working in a group and by interacting with peers,  students  will enhance  their  learning and skill set. As a group, and via collective effort,  students  will be able to make more progress in learning about and applying economic research, compared with tackling these questions independentl y. Students  learning  should improve significantly  in relation to  the course ILOs .  Group  work  also  provides useful experience which is relevant in a  non-univ e rsity  context, as managers often work in  teams  to analyse data and existing research to promote understanding of economic qu estions /problems  facing their firm or industry. 2.  Students will work in groups of 4 and will be able to select their group via Moodle.  3.  Each group's presentation/oral examination will be allocated up to 30 minutes and will be recorded for the purposes of second marking and external examiner's evaluation. The lecturer will ask questions during and after the presentation. Therefore, groups s hould time their presentation for about 15 minutes. 4.  Students should submit an electronic version of your presentation prior to the day of the presentation (dates for submission and for presentation will be advertised on Moodle). 5.  A grade will be allocated t o the group, assessing the quality of the work produced collectively. In particular, the grade will reflect both the quality of the economic analysis and the competence demonstrated in explaining and presenting the results and economic analysis. Therefore,  the grade will be based on the quality of the written work that has been submitted and presented, and on the performance of the group during the presentation, including the group's ability to answer questions by the lecturer. 6.  No reassessment opportunity i s provided. 7.  Groups must discuss the Business School's Assessed Groupwork Policy and agree how they will apply it at their first meeting.

The point of departure of the baseline Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is to postulate that the returns on stocks follow some exogenous probability distribution; the point of departure of the Black-Scholes analysis of option prices is that the price of the underlying share of stock follows some exogenous stochastic process. More generally, the standard theory of finance starts by postulating some exogenous stochastic process for the dividends or the prices of some interesting financial asset. The aim of this course is to analyse where these postulated processes are coming from. Indeed, although some financial series can be represented quite adequately, over some limited timespan, by an appropriate exogenous process, all financial series will eventually exhibit breaks.

As this is the first assessed course within the programme, a group assessment is used to ensure that students are given the opportunity to work in groups whilst becoming familiar with the demands of the MBA programme. In addition to the formal assessment, there is a considerable amount of class discussion in relation to theory and cases and feedback is continuously provided on students' understanding of the material. Main Assessment In:  December Are reassessment opportunities available for all summative assessments?  No Reassessments are normally available for all courses, except those which contribute to the Honours classification. For non  H onours courses, students are offered reassessment in all or any of the components of assessment if the satisfactory (threshold) grad e for the overall course is not achieved at the first attempt. This is normally grade D3 for undergraduate students and grade C3 for postgraduate students. Exceptionally it may not be possible to offer reassessment of some coursework items, in which case t he mark achieved at the first attempt will be counted towards the final course grade. Any such exceptions for this course are described below.     Reassessment opportunities are provided in accordance with School policy as applied to assessed groupwork. Course Aims This course aims to introduce students to the role of uncertainty in decision  making within organisations. In support of this, the course has several objectives: 1.  To highlight the processes by which decisions are made in organisations 2.  To differentiate between the rational and bounded rationality perspectives on decision making 3.  To  examine the role of knowledge, expertise and uncertainty within the  decision making  processes 4.  To differentiate between what is known and what is unknown and to assess its implications for the predictive validity associated with decisions ( both operational  and strategic) 5.  To introduce students to the principles of managing risk and the implications that risk may have for precautionary approaches to decision making within policy Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of  this course students will be able to: 1.  Explain the nature of risk, uncertainty, and indeterminacy and show how these elements impact on the decision-making process within organisations. 2.  Outline the processes by which decisions are made within organisations by adopting  a systems  based and holistic approach to decision making. 3.  Identify the components of a typical decision-making process and highlight its strengths and weaknesses 4.  Evaluate when, and how, domain specific knowledge is important in determining the nature and validity of expertise. 5.  Critically examine the rational model of decision making and show how it is limited in practice by the bounded nature of our rationality. 6.  Show how multiple rationalities can exist within the same decision space and illustrate the implications that this has for decision quality and especially in terms of their impact upon latent and active errors. 7.  Explain the latent and active elements of decision making and show how they can impact on organisational performance 8.  Be able to critically evaluate the processes by which teams make decisions and how both team based, and individual decision-making processes can be shaped by dysfunctional behaviours.

Instead they have to be solved by use of numerical algorithms and techniques implemented on a computer. For many applications the industry standard programming language is C++.  This course gives a comprehensive introduction to programming in C++ and covers some  of the  most f requently used applications in F inance.  These  include:  Monte Carlo  simulation for pricing complex financial derivatives; finite difference methods to solve partial differential equations such as the Black-Scholes equation; methods for the calibration of financial market models including volatility surfaces and term structures; GARCH models for high-frequency data and for forecasting. The implementation of these methods on the computer in C++ is a crucial component of the course.  It is expected that many  of the  computational finance techniques  used  w ill be covered in detail in the existing  course  ""Applied Computational Finance"" which is Matlab based. The newly proposed   course will focus on C++ and programming techniques mainly, while the examples from Computational Finance will merely serve for programming exercises. To make the newly proposed  course  a stand alone unit, some time however will be spent to briefly illustrate these techniques, focusing on the intuition, rather than computational detail. This will enable students who are not taking ""Applied Computational Finance"" and whose main motivation it is to acquire C++ programming skills to take this  course , but on the other side make it more interesting and praxis relevant. For optimal learning results we do recommend students however to take the new  course  in combination with ""Applied Computational Finance"".

Main Assessment In:  December Course Aims The aim of this course is to  introduce   modern econometrics.  The goal is to learn enough theory and get enough practice to be able to read journal articles and for conducting basic empirical research.   The emphasis is on applying econometrics to real-world  problems. However, a solid understanding of the reviewed inference procedures will require rudiments of probability theory and statistics, and the ability to prove few basic results.   The course focuses on regression analysis with cross-section data, under  the familiar assumption of random sampling. This setting simplifies the exposition of the main results, requiring assumptions that are relatively straightforward yet realistic. The analysis of time series data is postponed to the last part of the course.  This allows highlighting potential pitfalls that do not arise with cross-sectional data. Empirical exercises will be solved during computer lab sessions using an econometric software package . Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of the co urse, students should be able to :   1.  Derive some of the fundamental numerical and statistical properties of the OLS estimator. 2.  Critically interpret a regression output to answer a given research question. 3.  Critically evaluate the assumptions of the classical linear regression model and the ways they can be modified and with what effects. 4.  Translate an economic argument into a formal testable hypothesis within a multiple regression model and implement the appropriate testing procedure. 5.  Select the appropriate econometric tools and apply them to implement an empirical analysis using an econometric/statistical software package. 6.  Communicate effectively, using appropriate technical terms. 7.  Work collaboratively in a group to produce a combined output, by liaising with other class members, allocating tasks and co-ordinating group meetings.

In particular, the course will provide insights derived from a soft systems methodology (SSM) that integrates organisational and technological factors together to consider how effective technological change can be in the face of organisational constraints,  including knowledge of systems performance and the role played by expertise within the change process. Timetable The course is to be delivered over  3 full days , comprising of 21   hours of lectures. Requirements of Entry Registration on the MSc Financial Technology programme Excluded Courses None Co-requisites None Assessment Students will be expected to work on a real-world case to assess the systems elements associated with the introduction of a new technology into an organisation.    There will be a consultancy-based report to 'an organisation' of 3000 words which will focus  on ILOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. These reports will be peer assessed within the delegate group as well as by the teaching team. 40% of the marks  will be allocated from peer assessment and the remaining 60% from the academic team.   ILO 6 will be developed within  the lecture programme as students will be asked to present their findings to group members. Course Aims The course will  provide  an  introduction to  the main elements of the design of socio-technical systems in which the human, organisational, and technological elements interact together to generate emergent conditions that need to be managed. The course will introduce delegates to the soft systems me thodology developed by Checkland as a means of providing a framework to consider the impact that the various human elements within the system (customers, actors, and owners) and their world views (core beliefs, values and assumptions) can have on systems p erformance and particularly on the transformation processes that take place within the organisation. Of particular importance here is the role played by information within organisations and the effects that expertise and knowledge management can have in te rms of shaping and making sense of both the socio-technical system and its operating environment. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of this course students will be able to:   1.  Identify,  contextualise and critique the main elements in the design of a socio-technical system. 2.  Articulate and analyse the main elements of a system and frame it within the situational context in which a new technology is introduced into an organisation. This will  be achieved  through the use of the soft systems methodology approach as a complementary tool to a hard systems perspective  3.  Critique and analyse the use of information, knowledge, and expertise in the decision making  processes around the introduction and on-going management of a new technological development within an organisation.   4.   Develop and evaluate a range of strategic options for the introduction of new technologies into the organisation and to highlight the managerial change processes that will need to be employed in order to ensure that the strategy is successful.  5.  Consider t he potential for the failure of the technology change that is proposed and the limitations of expertise within that context and be able to develop and support contingency arrangements in support of on-going business continuity issues.  6.  Present the findings  of their analysis in both written and presentational forms.

The course has a strong international dimension.   This course aims to give students the opportunity to examine a number of different empirical models and theories of financial  institutions in a financial market setting. The aim is to  apply those theories in the analysis of  various issues, events and crises in the world of finance.   Students will explore the e mpirical and theoretical f oundations upon which  financial institution practice in financial markets are based. They will  examine the way in which decision making takes place within  these financial institutions in a financial market setting.  The course also aims to enable students to e valuate critically the role played by the  finance and banking  profession in maintaining  high quality decisions relative to the needs of shareholders and other stakeholders in   financial institution and financial market   contexts .   The precise course content will vary from year to year to include  a range of  up-to-date  models of financial institutions operating in a financial market setting  but will  consistently  cover the following:   ■  The e xamination of a range of  empirical models of financial institution operating in varying financial market  contexts . ■  E xploring  the specific  nature of retail, wholesal e, investment, and corporate banks  as independent banks and as constituent elem ents of a larger universal bank,  and  a  range of other financial fi rms such as, inter alia, insurance,  pension fund, unit and investment trust ,  venture  capital and private equity  and fund management firms . ■  Seeking to understand the common underlying finance and financial intermediation theory underpinning conventional understanding of all of these financial institutions.  ■  Exploring  the role of relevant managerial theory  in this institutional setting. Thus ,  concept s of intellectual capital (IC),  the theory  of the learning organisation,  the theory o f the knowledge  creating firm   and the resource based  theory of the (financial) firm  and 'performativity' are employed to develop novel insights i nto the nature and function of  financial institutions. ■  Exploiting the common c onceptual framework outlined in the course ( finance  theory  and managerial theory) to create  the  means for students to continue, during their careers, to be able to un derstand and analyse the modern  financial institution in a changin g world of technology, IC  and markets.  ■  Identification  of  various issues, events, crises facing  specific   financial institutions in financial market  contexts. ■  Using a range of 'orthodox finance theory and 'management  theor y' to jointly explain and explore the above . ■  Consideration  of the factors that may influence  high quality  decision-making  in financial institutions relative to the needs of shareholders and other stakeholders . ■  The a nalysis of a range of contemporary issues  in financial institutions  with an emphasis on issues that are currently being debated within the  finance and banking  profession and business. ■  The c ritique of examples of research within the field of  financial institutions and markets  .    The  course  makes extensive use of recent experiences, problems and crises in international banks and other financial i nstitutions to analyse many of  the difficult questions  in this area.   Students  will develop critical skills in assessing the  relevance of the principles of  finance, financial intermediation, learning and the knowledge creating firm, strategic choice about SCA, to real-world situations.  The emphasis throughout is on understanding and  being  able  to  articulate  the  fundamental  issues  involved  rather  than  on   developing computational expertise in applying the principles, although some computational ability will  be needed  to  demonstrate  this  understanding.     Students are expected to   make  full  use  of  the reading  lists  provided  and to demonstrate a wide reading of the academic  literature  in  their essay and exam questions.   Students are expected to use their own scholarship skills and own  reading of the literature to expand their understanding of banks and financial institutions. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of this course students will be able to:  1.

The course introduces students to an analysis of security valuation (of bonds, equity and derivative instruments), and the financing decision; should the cash needed for the investment be raised by issuing equity or debt, or by retaining profits in the firm?  To make sure these  decisions , managers need the guidance of finance theory as well as empirical evidence on issues such as:  how will borrowing affect the value of the firm and its share capital?  How will the payment of dividends affect the value of the shares and shareholder wealth?  This course addresses these and other core questions of financial management, and in doing so, introduces some of the key concepts of modern finance, including portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model, option pricing theory, market efficiency, and agency theory. Intended Learning Outcomes of Course By the end of the course, students should be able to:   1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the present value principle, and apply various investment appraisal techniques for investment decision making;  2.  Discuss various theories regarding the term structure of interest rates;  3.  Calculate the value of bonds, including the interest rate sensitivity (duration);  4.
