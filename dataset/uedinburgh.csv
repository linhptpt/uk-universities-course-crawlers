The course will review the history and development of design thinking through 4 paradigms, leading to an understanding of designing for experience through 4 orders - visual, material, service and system (Buchanan, 1992; Golsby-Smith, 1996).  This approach is applied and tested in practical work, understanding business models as designable constructions.         The first half of the course introduces you to the theoretical backgrounds underlying applied approaches to design thinking in a lecture and seminar format. A history of research regarding design activity is outlined, through two fundamental paradigms of thinking about design-as-method in the 1960s through to the design-as-knowledge application and expertise through the 1980s (Dorst 2006; Dorst & Dijkhuis 1995). The lectures will then introduce concepts of design-for-experience and interaction design, leading to the fundamental approach to the basic understanding of Design Thinking (Martin, 2009). The lectures conclude with the introduction of designing for complexity, going beyond interactions between users and artefacts towards experience and introduces the 4 orders of design: text/image; objects; services; and systems (Buchanan 1992) and, going forward, pursue the notion that designing is a form of practice involving placement. Throughout, special emphasis is placed upon understanding designing as both an iterative and generative activity, focusing on the fundamental practice of prototyping. The second half of the course provides the opportunity to engage practical, team-based exercises that will engage you to design and develop, through a project of intervention, an alternative model to an existing product, service, process or business model, prototype your developments and your their findings, leading to an individual case study as a final submission interrogating the value of design methods and design thinking in an entrepreneurship and innovation context.

Structural Engineering Design Project 5 mimics the real-world design of a bridge in a civil engineering consultancy. Students work within design teams to carry out a feasibility study for a new bridge, involving all aspects of the design process from the initial concept through to detailed design. One of the principle aims of the project is to draw together subjects learnt during the degree programme, to remind students of methods that they have perhaps forgotten, and to make sure they could start work in a real design office.  As in any real design situation, however, it will also be necessary to learn new skills to tackle the project, and in this case that will involve self-led study of aspects of bridge engineering (including construction methods, costs, Eurocodes for bridge design, and computer analysis tools). The project has been developed over many years with the help of experienced senior bridge engineers, based on the skills that are needed by graduate engineers in their practices and upon the type of problem that an engineer needs to be able to tackle to become chartered.  The range and depth of tasks that students tackle will be appropriate to a MEng degree.  The project is split into two parts.  During the first week students work on the Outline Design for two different concepts, which will involve selecting the most appropriate design tools to explore and develop the designs. During the second week, students proceed with the Detailed Design of one of these solutions, and there are opportunities for members of the design team to focus on different aspects of the detailed design (such as examining safe construction methods, or detailed modelling of a specific aspect of the bridge).

In the most narrow sense, it refers to observations involving high energy photons, primarily X-rays and gamma-rays. In a broader and more astrophysical view, it refers to the study of objects such as supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, binary X-ray sources, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, radio jets, and clusters of galaxies, which involve extreme conditions, like high energies, temperatures, or densities. These objects have high energy particles, even if the photons that they emit have much lower energies. This course examines the many physical processes which are important in the structure and emission of light from extreme astrophysical sources. Starting from Maxwell's equations, the classical theory of radiation from an accelerated charge is developed, and generalised to the relativistic case. Topic studied then include: synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons gyrating in a magnetic field; the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies; Compton and inverse Compton scattering; accretion of material onto compact objects; Radio galaxies and quasars, and their jets; bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas; cooling flows and the role of black holes in galaxy formation.

The laws of dynamics are then reformulated in the Lagrangian framework, in which a scalar quantity (the Lagrangian) takes centre stage.  The equations of motion then follow by differentiation, and can be obtained directly in terms of whatever generalised coordinates suit the problem at hand.  These ideas are encapsulated in Hamilton's principle, a statement that the motion of any classical system is such as to extremise the value of a certain integral.  The laws of mechanics are then obtained by a method known as the calculus of variations.  As a problem-solving tool, the Lagrangian approach is especially useful in dealing with constrained systems, including (for example) rotating rigid bodies, and one aim of the course is to gain proficiency in such methods.

It serves both as a preparation for further study in physics-based degree courses, and as a stand-alone course for students of other disciplines, including (but not limited to) mathematics, chemistry, computer science and engineering.         Section 1: The Tools of the Trade This introductory section explores what Physics is and reviews the key tools (mental, not metal) needed in the practice of Physics. 1.1 The trade: what is Physics? 1.2 Units 1.3 Numbers 1.4 Vectors 1.5 Problem solving  Section 2: Space and Time Physics deals with the sequence of events that make up the unfolding story of the universe. The most basic questions we can ask about 'events' are 'where?' and 'when?' Thus Space and Time are the key concepts of physics. In this section we explore the classical view of Space and Time developed by Galileo and Newton, and touch on its failures, unearthed by Einstein. 2.1 One dimensional particle kinematics 2.2 Kinematics in two (or three) dimensions 2.3 Application: projectile motion 2.4 Application: circular motion 2.5 Relativity: the common sense view 2.6 Relativity: Einstein's view  Section 3: Force Mass and Motion Understanding a changing world means understanding motion. This section is concerned with the key concepts (mass, force) underlying the classical Newtonian theory of motion, and expressed in Newton's three laws. We illustrate the application of these laws in the context of a wide range of forces, and touch on some of the curious 'forces' encountered in 'accelerating' reference frames. 3.1 Inertial reference frames: Newton's 1st Law 3.2 Force and mass: Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws 3.3 How to use Newton's Laws 3.4 Classification of forces 3.5 Gravitational force near the earth's surface 3.6 Normal contact force 3.7 Tension 3.8 Frictional force 3.9 Linear restoring force 3.10 The centripetal force 3.11 The gravitational force 3.12 The electrostatic force 3.13 Fictitious forces  Section 4: Energy and Work To describe the changing world around us, we must describe its state. Energy is one of the key tools that allow us to do this. In this section we explore the concept of energy: its definition, its conservation and its utility in problem solving. 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Work 4.3 Power: the rate of working 4.4 Kinetic energy 4.5 Potential energy 4.6 Potential energy: examples 4.7 Energy conservation  Section 5: Linear Momentum The concept of the linear momentum of a system of particles is an extremely fruitful one in many areas of physics. In this section we develop the tools needed to describe the motion of such a system, and deduce that momentum must be conserved for an isolated system. This allows us to analyse elastic and inelastic collisions. We will also look at what happens to our view of mass, momentum and energy for objects moving at very high speeds. 5.1 Preview 5.2 Systems of particles 5.3 Motion of the centre of mass 5.4 Linear momentum 5.5 Linear momentum and its conservation 5.6 Collisions 5.7 Relativity: Mass, Momentum and Energy  Section 6: Angular Momentum In this section we develop concise methods of describing rotational motion using quantities such as angular velocity, angular momentum and moment of inertia, the rotational analogues of velocity, momentum and mass. Using this new language, we can describe such counterintuitive phenomena as the behaviour of spinning tops and gyroscopes, and find out why it is easier to ride a bicycle with bigger wheels. 6.1 Linear and rotational motion 6.2 Angular positions, velocities and accelerations 6.3 Relations between angular and linear quantities 6.4 Constant acceleration equations 6.5 Kinetic energy of a rotating body: moment of inertia 6.6 Torque 6.7 Angular momentum 6.8 Angular momentum conservation  Section 7: Oscillations Understanding and exploiting oscillations is central to many aspects of science including physics, chemistry, biology and engineering.

The project work not only provides insights into real-world challenges for mathematics and how mathematical scientists work with industry, but also provides general research skills training to give you experience in a broad range of activities that will be useful during and after your PhD, irrespective of your topic and later employment. Each group will have an academic supervisor and a contact from industry. Ideally each group will have a mixed skill set so that some members can work on background theory, others on modelling, and some on efficient implementation. The output is a joint presentation and a written report submitted at the end of the semester.   A second model has a similar structure to MIGS: Project 1 but is undertaken in a different area.   A third model introduces the group to a set of widely-used techniques in a given broad area. Overseen by one or more academic supervisors, you will give individual seminar-style presentations (covering the basic notions of each technique, together with some applications that you have researched yourselves) to the rest of the group.

MATH11190,Mathematics,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_math.htm,"Although risk and uncertainty affect our everyday life, both are very vague concepts. As a result, there does not exist a concise definition for them that holds in general. Different public and industrial sectors will assess and manage risk in very different ways, depending on whether past observations are available, who severe outcomes can be, whether it affects only few or many, etc. Therefore, after a general introduction, specific examples from various sectors are discussed to illustrate how differing the approaches to assess and manage risk can be in practice. These sectors will include, finance, medicine, engineering and, most notably, logistics. Concerning the latter, in 2012, the total expenditure for logistics activities in Europe was 1,726 billion Euros and thus even small improvements may result in considerable monetary gains. Starting in the 1950s, optimization and OR techniques have been developed and used to optimize logistics activities, with an ever increasing importance, role and proliferation since then. Uncertainty and risk are inherent in logistics: Customer demand can never be forecasted exactly, travel times will never be certain, and machines or vehicles may break down, severely affecting and impairing logistics operations.         The core of risk analysis deals with questions like: What is risk? How to measure it? And what to do about it? The answers to those questions will vary from sector to sector. The course will start with introducing basic concepts of risk analysis, focusing especially on decision trees, expected utility theory and decision making under complete uncertainty. Afterwards, examples from different application areas will be discussed and it will be show how to apply these (and other) concepts to tackle the corresponding problems. Examples will include applications in finance, medicine, engineering and, most notably, logistics.  Logistics focuses on moving objects, e.g. goods, in space and time such that the right object is in the right quantity at the right time at the right place. Classical logistics activities are the transportation and distribution of raw materials, subassemblies, and finished products between suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retailers, and their storage, handling, processing, and packaging. Typical goals are to maximize customer satisfaction (expressed through service levels, product quality, responsiveness, etc.) and to minimize total costs, environmental impact, and tied-up equity. Logistics planners face many challenges, ranging from conflicting goals, over supply uncertainties, uncertain customer demands and the lack of information, to the inherent difficulties of having to organize logistics activities across borders and cultures in multi-national companies.  This course will focus on OR techniques to optimize the structure of the logistics network and to efficiently transport, store, and distribute goods. For each of those problems, a brief introduction and a characterization of the different types of sub-problems will be given. Afterwards, mathematical models and algorithms to solve classical problems will be discussed, each accompanied by small case studies.  The overall course outline is as follows:  Part I: Risk Analysis 1. Decision Making under Uncertainty - Introduction - Expected Utility - Having (no) Clues About the Future 2. Examples of Risk in Practice - Risk in Medicine - (Personal) Financial Risk - Risk in Engineering  Part II: Logistics 3.

The focus is on selected topics in finance (such as arbitrage detection, risk-neutral probability measure, portfolio theory and asset management), where the models can be formulated as deterministic or stochastic optimization problems. These problems have various forms (e.g. linear, quadratic, conic, convex, stochastic optimization) and hence various tools, techniques and methods from optimization need to be employed to solve them numerically. An integral part of the goal of the course is to gain skills in detecting this so that the right algorithms and optimization methodology is applied. The course is designed as 2 hours of lectures and 2 hours of MATLAB-based labs every week, in a continuous 4 hour session, during a 7 week period. The labs are hands-on and are aimed at building a practical skillset for solving realistic problems, and are related to the theoretical material covered in the lectures that day.         1.

Multiscale systems are ubiquitous across various scientific areas, including chemical and biological processes or material science, and are characterised by nontrivial interactions between a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The high complexity of multi-scale systems implies that accurate description of the underlying problem is either impossible or practically intractable and, instead, a coarse-grained approach must be used. The set of techniques discussed in this course - commonly referred to as averaging and homogenisation - is applicable to problems characterised by separation of scales and described by either ODEs, PDEs or SDEs.  The driving principle behind this approach is to derive systematic approximations of the original highly heterogeneous system so that the simplified description, which effectively 'averages out' the microscopic features, provides an accurate description of the system properties at the 'macro' scales of interest. The main advantage of this approach is that the resulting equations are much more amenable to rigorous analysis and numerical implementation. We will also discuss conditions which are necessary for the solution to the full equations to converge to the averaged/homogenised description in the limit of the scale of the small-scale inhomogeneities tending to zero.

The main goal of this course is to present a mathematically unified and systematic framework for data assimilation, which provides a basis for derivation and analysis of algorithmic approaches, and for implementing 'informed' approximations which are needed in practical applications.   Modern scientific applications involving time-dependent state estimation and control require integration of noisy empirical data with uncertain dynamical models for improving accuracy of the resulting predictions. Such strategies are essential in practical applications and have been applied - in an ad-hoc fashion - in engineering and weather forecasting for a few decades. More applications emerge rapidly in the financial sector, machine learning, and other areas of data science due to a rapidly increasing availability of empirical data.    Students taking the course will gain a comprehensive understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of various data assimilation techniques, and they will gain the ability to implement relevant approaches algorithmically based on a number of worked examples. The Bayesian formulation of the data assimilation procedure will allow for quantifying the uncertainty associated with the resulting estimates.

The biomedical setting is rich in opportunities to apply mathematical approaches of different types to the analysis of patient data. These range from routine data collected from national registries, to collections of high-dimensional biomarkers measured via high-throughput techniques, to genetic and sequence data.

Established with the invention of differential calculus in the 1600s by Newton and Leibniz, dynamics was at first primarily concerned with the exact solution of differential equations. It was not until the 1800s that Poincaré's work triggered a paradigm shift towards a more qualitative point of view: instead of exact formulae, he emphasised a geometric approach, enquiring for instance about the long-term behaviour of solutions or their dependence on parameters. Poincaré also theorised the possibility of chaos, which is characterised by the sensitive dependence of solutions on their initial conditions, thus making forecasts unreliable.   The theory of dynamical systems has since matured, through its centuries-long history, and has found innumerable applications, not least in the life sciences; the resulting branch of mathematics is often broadly referred to as mathematical biology, and will be the focus of this course. The applications covered may include Michaelis-Menten-type enzyme kine+cs, growth and control of brain tumours, travelling fronts in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, the dynamics of infectious diseases, waves of pursuit and evasion in predator-prey systems, oscillations in population-based models, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model for neuronal impulses.

The course will make substantial use of elementary group theory. There are links to Year 3 Geometry and Year 4 Topology (but knowledge from those courses is not assumed).

Hyperbolic geometry and symmetry.   6. Other topics in symmetry and geometry as decided by the class.     From the earliest times and across cultures, people have been fascinated by patterns: objects or drawings that possess symmetry. As well as their aesthetic appeal, patterns are important in the material world because, for example, substances that crystallise are forming repeating patterns. Understanding the possible repeating patterns in the plane and in space is therefore a necessary part of understanding the structure of materials.    In mathematics, the symmetries of an object form a group, and this course is to some extent an extended exercise in applied, practical group theory. In this course we will study the symmetry groups of two and three dimensional Euclidean space and the subgroups of them that are symmetries of repeating patterns in the plane ('wallpaper patterns'), on the sphere and on friezes (infinite strips). We will see that five-fold symmetry is impossible in wallpaper patterns and that there are in fact precisely 17 different possible symmetry groups. These patterns can be found in art and decoration throughout the ages. We will study also symmetric colourings of patterns and how this relates to group homomorphisms.     Our study of this will be based on a notation popularised by John Conway in around 1990, which relates the characteristic features of the pattern to its 'orbifold' which is something like a surface but may have certain sorts of 'bad points' such as the 'conical singularity' at the base of an ice cream cone. We will need to understand about the geometry and topology of orbifolds and their 'Euler characteristics'.    We will use the same methods also to understand the geometry behind some of the remarkable patterns produced by the artist Escher, which are based on repeating patterns in hyperbolic space. For this, we will need to study the geometry of hyperbolic space, which is also important in the history of mathematics for being an early example of 'non-euclidean geometry'.     ¿Hands-on¿ involvement week by week and group working will be expected.

Numerical methods for ODEs allow for the computation of approximate solutions and are essential for their quantitative study. In some cases, a numerical method can facilitate qualitative analysis as well, such as probing the long term solution behaviour. As well as studying the theory, the course has a strong emphasis on implementation of these methods (in Python) to tackle modern applications of ODEs.         This course begins by introducing basic numerical schemes, such as Euler's method, including a study of their derivation and convergence properties. It then discusses more accurate approaches such as Taylor series methods, numerical quadrature, and Runge-Kutta schemes, in terms of both their theoretical properties and practical implementation. The related ideas of consistency, stability and convergence of numerical methods will then be studied, as well as the corresponding order conditions for Runge-Kutta schemes.   Motivated by a range of applications, more advanced techniques such as variable step size methods and linear multi-step approaches will be developed, again studying both theoretical and practical aspects.   Finally, more specialised schemes will be presented. These are strongly application-dependent and could include geometric integration, symplectic methods, splitting schemes, shooting methods, or techniques for tackling differential-algebraic equations.

In Honours Analysis we extended the theory of limits to sequences of real functions and studied uniform convergence. In this course we extend these notions to the more general setting of metric spaces, i.e., sets equipped with a distance (metric).  Many important spaces in Analysis have metrics. For example, the space of square integrable functions which is used in the study of Fourier series is equipped with the L² metric,and the Sobolev spaces that are used in PDEs are equipped with metrics that measure the size of derivatives.

The utility of these models will be showcased in a variety of applications which may include population biology, gene expression, mathematical physiology, enzyme kinetics, virus dynamics, and neuronal modelling. Substantial use will be made of ordinary differential equations and, to a lesser extent, of complex variables; the course hence builds on Honours Differential Equations (MATH10066) and Honours Complex Variables (MATH10067).  A suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Continuous and discrete population models. Perturbations and bifurcations. Interacting populations. Oscillators and switches. Chemical reaction kinetics. Disease dynamics. Reaction-diffusion equations. Waves and fronts. Spatial patterns.         The history of mathematical biology dates back at least to the 1100s, when Fibonacci described the growth of rabbit populations in terms of what is now known as Fibonacci series. Early applied mathematicians focussed mostly on the modelling of population and disease: in the 1700s, Bernoulli modelled the spread of smallpox, while Malthus popularised the concept of exponential growth. Applications in evolutional ecology followed in the 1800s, when Müller investigated mimicry in light of natural selection, thus influencing the later works of Darwin.  The field of mathematical biology has since grown considerably, and diverged into a number of specialised areas beyond the traditional ones of ecology and epidemiology. Mathematical modelling has become an indispensable tool in the biomedical sciences as the latter have become increasingly quantitative; in that sense, mathematical biology is a truly interdisciplinary discipline. The focus of this course will be on practical applications of dynamical models which take the form of difference or (ordinary and partial) differential equations. The applications covered may include Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, front propagation in reaction-diffusion equations, competition in predator-prey systems, expression in gene regulatory networks, the dynamics of disease, or relaxation oscillation in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.

From Newton's laws of motion, to Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics and Einstein's equations of relativity, Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical language to describe the physical world. It is perhaps less known that PDEs have been the driving force behind a large part of Analysis. The theory of Fourier series was first developed in an attempt to solve the wave and heat equations. A large part of the modern theory of Integration was developed in order to make rigorous sense of the integrals that appear in the formulas defining the Fourier coefficients. More recently, a stunning success of geometric PDEs was Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture, a long-standing problem in Topology, using the Ricci flow.  This course is a rigorous introduction to the wave, heat, and Laplace equations. These are the prototypes of hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic equations, the three main types of PDEs. We'll investigate under what conditions solutions exist and whether or not they are unique. We'll also study some of the basic properties of solutions such as finite speed of propagation, the Huygens principle and conservation of energy.

The course also includes computer algebra, to support and illustrate some of the content.         One great power of mathematics is abstraction. Here abstraction is the distillation of a mathematical idea to its essence - in the case of linear algebra, understanding what unifies points, lines and planes, and so on. This turns out to be very useful. Why? Well two apparently different ideas can turn out to have the same underlying structure, and then insight you get from one can reveal the other. Think of a dictionary, allowing you to translate the masterpieces of one language into another. [Of course, you still need to work hard to make a good translation.] Second, it is often easier to understand general structure than it is to understand specific examples. Many mathematicians think ""if you can't answer a particular question, generalise it - it might become easier!"".

The multilinear algebra of determinants is studied, together with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, culminating in the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and the Perron-Frobenius Theorem. This is followed by an introduction to inner product spaces and the Spectral Theorem. The course then moves on to normal forms for linear transformations and particularly the Jordan Normal Form.

The rest of the course will then develop the classic theory of surfaces. This will be done in the modern language of differential forms. Surfaces possess a notion of intrinsic geometry and many of the more advanced aspects of differential geometry can be demonstrated in this simpler context. One of the main aims will be to quantify the notions of curvature and shape of surfaces. The culmination of the course will be a sketch proof of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, a profound result which relates the curvature of surfaces to their topology.  Syllabus:  Curves in Euclidean space: regularity, velocity, arc-length, Frenet-Serret frame, curvature and torsion, equivalence problem.  Calculus in R^n: tangent vectors, vector fields, differential forms, moving frames, connection forms, structure equations.  Surfaces in Euclidean space: regularity, first and second fundamental forms, curvatures (principal, mean, Gauss), isometry, Gauss's Theorema Egregium, geodesics on surfaces, integration of forms, statement of Stokes' theorem, Euler characteristic, Gauss-Bonnet theorem (sketch proof).

Emphasis will be placed both on the mathematical techniques and on problem formulation through examples from applications.         Dynamic Optimisation is a neat way of solving sequential decision problems based on recursion. Its power comes from the fact that some important classes of optimisation problems that ""ought to be difficult"" can be reformulated as a recursive optimisation problem and thus made tractable. Examples are network optimisation problems, allocation problems and inventory problems.  Integer Optimisation provides a general method of solving problems with logical or integrality constraints. Solution methods include Branch-and-Bound and Gomory Cuts. Much emphasis will be placed on how to express various types of restrictions that may appear in optimisation problems (like logical conditions) can be expressed using integer variables.  Game Theory is concerned with mathematical modelling of behaviour and optimal decision making in competitive strategic situations in which the success of strategic choices of one individual (person, company, server, ...) depends on the choices of other (intelligent) ""players"" that each have their own (possibly conflicting) agenda.  Note that Dynamic Optimisation and Integer Optimisation were historically called ""Dynamic Programming"" and ""Integer Programming"" respectively (the term ""programming"" in these words did not mean ""computer programming"" but rather decision making).   Dynamic Optimisation Multistage decision processes; principle of optimality. Applications: network problems; inventory problem; resource allocation problem; knapsack problem; stochastic problems.  Integer Optimisation Modelling: set-up costs, batch production, limited number of production methods. Logical constraints; set covering problems; systematic conversion of logical expression to IP constraints. Solution techniques: branch and bound; Gomory pure integer cuts.

After the foundations are established the course focuses on practical methods for solving systems of polynomial equations. An important branch of algebra in its own right, commutative algebra is an essential tool to explore several other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, number theory, Galois theory, Lie theory, and non-commutative algebra.

MATH08058,Mathematics,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_math.htm,"Calculus is one of the most fundamental tools in mathematics and its applications. This course presents an introduction to the two main branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. At the heart of both lies the notion of the limit of a function, sequence, or series. In addition to promoting a conceptual appreciation of these foundations of calculus, the course will develop calculational facility, both of which are essential for further mathematical study.  A suggested syllabus for the course is as follows. Functions. Limits and continuity. Differentiation: techniques and applications. Inverse functions. Integration: techniques and applications. Fundamental theorem of calculus. Sequences and series. Taylor and Maclaurin series. Differential equations.          It is probably fair to say that calculus represents one of the biggest achievements in the history of human thought. It took mankind almost two millennia to go from Archimedes first attempts to estimate areas to the birth of the subject as we know it today with the work of Newton and Leibniz in the 1600s and even after that it took another two centuries before the foundations of the subject were firmly laid. In that sense, calculus marks the birth of modern mathematics: its influence on scientific and technological developments over the centuries since its inception cannot be overstated. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to calculus; the focus will be firmly on the two traditional branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Roughly speaking, the former is concerned with rates of change (""derivatives""), while the latter studies accumulated quantities (""integrals""). The connection between the two is established by the fundamental theorem of calculus which lies at the heart of the subject, and which in turn relies on the notion of the limit of a function.  The course will explore some of the implications of these and related notions, and will cover a variety of techniques and applications of both differentiation and integration; examples include the mean value theorem, curve sketching, and (unconstrained or constrained) optimisation, as well as areas and volumes, arc length, and improper integrals. The convergence of infinite sequences and series will be another focus in the course. Further applications may include (elementary) differential equations from physics and engineering.  Depending on the mode of delivery, lectures or screencasts on assigned reading will be augmented through (formal and informal) collaborative discussion, thus implementing a ""flipped classroom"" setting. Real-time workshops will involve group-based activities to cement concepts, and expand on applications introduced in screencasts.

In particular we consider (i) post-quantum security: security of classical protocols when the adversaries have access to quantum computers or other quantum technologies and (ii) quantumly-enhanced security: when quantum technologies are used by honest parties to achieve better (in terms of security or efficiency) performance. We give an overview of the field, while in each case we focus on selected examples to illustrate how to handle security in a world with quantum technologies.         This course deals with the various effects that developing quantum technologies will have on cyber security. Quantum computing and quantum information theory offers new possibilities (in terms of efficiency and security). Here we examine both the extra attacks that adversaries equipped with quantum technologies can perform and the extra possibilities opened when honest parties use quantum technologies.  The students first will be introduced to quantum information concepts (qubits, mixed states, operations, distance measures) as well as quantum algorithms (factoring, discrete logarithms, search) and their limitations. This will lead to LO1, namely learn the mathematical machinery and the power (and limitations) of quantum information and computation, in view of using these for cyber security.  The second part consists of learning and understanding quantum cryptography and specifically ""quantum-key-distribution"" protocols, including their security proofs and the how different implementations affect the performance (see LO4). The limitations (practical and theoretical) of quantum cryptography will also be analysed here (including impossibility results).  The third part deals with generalising classical notions such as encryption, authentication and secure delegated computation to quantum information. Introducing students in these concepts prepares them for the next generation of quantum cyber security that is bound to become relevant when large(r) quantum computers are constructed (LO5).  Finally, the last part of the course focuses on classical protocols and their security under quantum attacks. A cryptosystem based on the learning-with-errors problems will be introduced as a (key) example of this possibility (LO2).

The good news is that we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Instead there are many different approaches (called parallel patterns) that have been developed by the community and can be used in a variety of situations. These patterns apply equally well regardless of whether our problem is a computational one or data driven.  Understanding and being able to apply these patterns also helps getting to grips with existing parallel codes and optimising poorly performing computation and data codes. Whilst the lectures take a top down approach, focusing on the patterns themselves, the practical tutorials give students the opportunity to explore the concepts by implementing pattern based solutions to problems using common HPC technologies.         Reusability is a key driver of this module, both reusability of knowledge (the patterns themselves) and parallel codes (via frameworks.) The parallel patterns (known as a pattern language) that we cover are split into two categories.

These are implementation strategy patterns and include: - Master/Worker - Loop Parallelism - Fork/Join - Shared Data and Queues - Active Messaging  Patterns are described on an abstract level and we will also discuss enhancements that can be made to improve performance/scalability but at the cost of code complexity. Implementations of these patterns are explored in depth in the tutorials. This module also covers parallel frameworks and how we might write generic implementations of patterns which can be applied to numerous problems. Design principals of frameworks, along with popular HPC libraries will be explored so that students understand both from a design and also implementation perspective how to write generic parallel code.

However, they can also be used to search for rules and rule sets, for data mining, for good feed-forward or recurrent neural nets and so on. The idea of evolving, rather than designing, algorithms and controllers is especially appealing in AI.

Data is everywhere, coming in different shapes and volumes, and needs to be stored and managed using appropriate data management technologies. The basic software package that supports the management of data is called a database management system (DBMS). The main goal of this course is to explain some of the underlying theoretical principles and characteristics of DBMSs. More precisely, this course will explain how real-life concepts (such as a database and a query) and phenomena (such as incompleteness and inconsistency of data), can be abstracted from their physical implementation and mathematically formalised using tools coming from other areas such as computational logic. This will pave the way towards the study of query evaluation, that is, the central task of extracting meaningful information from (possibly incomplete and inconsistent) data by means of queries, following a mathematically rigorous approach. This analysis will expose the source of complexity in evaluating a query over a database, which in turn provides ideas and tools on how to devise more efficient query evaluation algorithms.         The course will cover the following topics: - Relational model: data model, relational algebra, relational calculus (first-order queries), first-order query evaluation, static analysis of first-order queries (satisfiability and containment).  - Conjunctive queries (CQs): syntax and semantics (via the notion of homomorphism), CQ evaluation, static analysis of CQs (satisfiability, containment and the Homomorphism Theorem), minimisation of CQs.  - Fast conjunctive query evaluation: acyclic CQs, evaluating acyclic CQs (Yannakaki's algorithm), semantically acyclic CQs and their evaluation, size bounds for joins (AGM bound), worst-case optimal join algorithms.  - Adding recursion - Datalog: inexpressibility of recursive queries, syntax and semantics of Datalog, Datalog query evaluation, static analysis of Datalog queries, Datalog vs. first-order queries.   - Uncertainty - reasoning over possible worlds: incomplete databases, inconsistent databases, probabilistic databases, knowledge-enriched databases.  Student will be assessed 100% by in-course assessment:  - Essay 1 (formative): students will choose a research paper (from a given list) on the relational model, and present (i) a summary of the paper, and (ii) analysis and critical thoughts (criticism of the paper, and discussion on follow-up papers that show how the ideas of the paper under review have influenced the field). The length of the essay must be 5 to 7 pages (including references). Each essay should be clearly written in sentences with appropriate punctuation, display of formulae, appropriate use of ""Definition"", ""Lemma"", ""Theorem"", ""Proof"", etc. The work should be properly and adequately referenced in the text, with the full list of references at the end of the essay, following any of the standard labelling conventions as technical papers (e.g., numerical, or by abbreviated name). The essay will be marked on its clarity and technical accuracy, which are equally important criteria. It must be understood by someone who has not read the paper. Of course, in reality, it will be marked by someone who has read the paper, but still this is an important criterion that will be used in marking.  - Essay 2 (50%): as for Essay 1, but with the difference that students will choose a research paper on a topic covered during the lectures (not only on the relational model as for Essay 1). The essay will be marked on its clarity (25%) and technical accuracy (25%).  - Take-home test (50%): students will complete a take-home test at the end of the course, which will consist of three problems on relational queries, Datalog queries, and uncertain data. The problems will be of variable difficulty (easy - 10%, medium - 15%, hard - 25%). For the hard problem, a hint that will guide the student towards the final solution will be given.

Formal verification techniques are exhaustive and provide much stronger guarantees of correctness than testing or simulation-based approaches. They are particularly useful for safety and security critical systems and for when system behaviour is highly complex. The course focuses on automated techniques that are currently used in industry. It gives practical exposure to current formal verification tools, explaining the input languages used and introducing the underlying mathematical techniques and algorithms used for automation.         In recent years there have been highly noteworthy cases of the adoption of formal verification (FV) techniques in industry. For example, at Intel, FV has largely replaced simulation-based verification of their microprocessors, at Microsoft, FV is used to certify that 3rd party drivers are free of certain kinds of concurrency bugs. As FV tools and methodologies improve, FV is expected to become more and more widely used in industry.  This course aims to familiarise students with main classes of FV techniques that are likely to become most widespread in industry in the coming years. The intent is to prepare students who might go into industry with sufficient background in FV that they would be aware of when and how they might deploy FV techniques. The course will also be of interest to students who wish to go into research developing techniques for future-generation FV tools and who might need to use FV in their research. To satisfy these aims, the course has a practical focus, giving students hands-on experience with a number of tools and explaining their input languages for specifying systems and desired system properties. The course also introduces the underlying mathematical techniques, which gives students a deeper understanding of the tools and will help them use the tools most effectively.

INFR11128,Informatics,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_infr.htm,"Category theory is a powerful mathematical tool in logic and informatics, that has influenced the design of modern (functional and quantum) programming languages. It replaces concrete and often cumbersome set-theoretic encodings with more elegant abstractions that reveal the intrinsic structure underlying them. Category theory shines at easing complicated bookkeeping. In particular, a powerful graphical calculus lets us draw pictures instead of writing algebraic expressions. This technique is visually extremely insightful, yet completely rigorous. For example, correctness of protocols often comes down to whether a picture is connected or disconnected, whether there is information flow from one end to another. This course develops the basic ideas of category theory by applying them to quantum informatics. It investigates the conceptual reasons why quantum protocols and quantum computing work, rather than their algorithmic and complexity-theoretic aspects.         The course begins by introducing the idea behind category theory and the breadth of its scope. Why would it be a good idea to abstract away from specific hard-coded set-theoretic structures, and have compositional denotational semantics, in general? Illustrations from functional programming and categorical methods in logic are given.  We then focus more specifically on monoidal categories. Via lectures and self-study reading, the course teaches students the basics of dual objects in monoidal categories. Specific attention is paid to the graphical calculus, which makes the topic visually apparent. Via weekly exercise sheets, and their review incorporated into the contact hours, the student learns to graphically manipulate algebraic objects such as monoids and Frobenius structures. He/she will understand that this still allows perfectly rigorous proofs of correctness, and be able to see the information flow of a protocol that is often hidden behind superfluous details.  Throughout the course, the abstract material is linked to quantum informatics. We will categorically model notions typically thought to belong to quantum theory, such as entanglement, no-cloning, teleportation, and complementarity. But it will turn out some of these notions also make perfect sense in other settings. For example, the very same categorical description of quantum teleportation also describes classical encryption with a one-time pad. We identify characteristics of classical and quantum information, aiming to equip students to choose the right tools and techniques for future problems they may encounter.

It began life in Economics in the 1940's with the work of von Neumann & Morgenstern, but has since been applied to an extraordinary range of subjects, including political science, evolutionary biology & even to inspection regimes for arms control.   Game theory has for years also played an important, if less recognized, role in several branches of computer science. Applications within computer science include the use of games in automated verification & model checking to model computing systems in an unknown and possibly adverse environment. In AI games are applied to the analysis of multi-agent systems. Recently, with the advent of the internet and e-commerce, many game theoretic questions in the interplay between economics & computing have received extensive attention. These include electronic auctions, & more generally mechanism design questions (inverse game theory) related to finding incentive structures for cooperation between independent entities on the internet.

Are all `computers' basically the same? Can we tell whether our programs are `correct' - and what does `correct' mean, anyway? Can we solve problems in reasonable time, and can we tell whether we can? The course concentrates primarily on conceptual understanding, but adds enough detail to allow students to go on to further courses, and illustrates how the fundamental concepts are reflected throughout the discipline.           The first section of the course asks the question, what does it mean to compute? We start with the finite automata introduced in earlier years, and then generalise to pushdown automata, and show that they have more power. Next we generalize further to very simple abstract general computers, and argue they can do everything real computers can do. We then ask, can we solve every computational question? The answer, with which Turing shocked the mathematicians of the 1930s, is ""no"", with a remarkably easy but beautiful argument (introduced at the end of Inf2-IADS). We then explore some different, but always equivalent, ways of defining ""a computer"". We finish the section by asking how we can compare the difficulty of different problems, and introduce the idea of ""reduction"" as a way of compiling one problem into another. Technically, this covers register machines, undecidability, Turing machines, and reductions.  The second section thinks about how hard it is to solve solvable problems, leading to one of the most important problems in all mathematics, and the foundation of internet security. We start by reprising Inf2-IADS analysis of algorithms, and then discuss the idea of classifying problems as `tractable' (easy) or `intractable' (hard). We find that the idea of algorithms whose running time grows polynomially in the problem size is a good mathematical definition of `tractable', though not always a practical one. After making this more precise, we ask what happens if we're allowed to just check all the possible answers in parallel - does this give us more problem-solving power? The question is made precise by the concept of NP, and we show that there are ""hardest"" such problems, such as the famous Travelling Salesman. Although the question is easy to ask, nobody knows how to answer it. This is P = NP - if you can solve it, you win a million dollars, and fame for as long as civilization lasts.   So far, NP problems are very hard to solve in practice, so we discuss how to deal with them. We finish the section by talking about much harder problems still. Technically, this section covers P, NP, hardness and completeness, Cook's Theorem, P = NP, and the complexity hierarchy above NP.  The third section takes brief look at a different way of seeing computation. Haskell needn't be seen as a programming language, it can be the computer itself. We'll show how the lambda-calculus (on which Haskell is based) can do all the computing our other models could, and how the halting problem was actually first solved (or rather unsolved) within lambda-calculus.

Paradoxically, they are among the most permanent features of the computing landscape (Fortran, for example, is still widely used 60 years since its invention), and among the most energetic and innovative, with new programming languages introduced every few months, often aiming to simplify Web programming, parallel, or distributed computing.  Although few computer scientists will ever design a new, general-purpose language like Java or C++, all computer scientists need the ability to learn new languages quickly, recognise and use (or avoid misusing) common language features, and even design new domain-specific languages for restricted problem domains. The design of programming languages involves many subtle choices and tradeoffs among performance, convenience, and elegance.   This course covers the essential programming structures for managing data and controlling computation, as well as abstractions that facilitate decomposing large systems into modules. The course also covers pragmatics of programming languages, including abstract syntax, interpretation and domain-specific language implementation.

You will first acquire a working knowledge of digital design, through the Verilog Hardware Description Language, along with a good theoretical grounding in the design of the key components of a microprocessor. You will have an opportunity to learn, both theoretically and practically, how the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture enables computer architects to analyse and optimize microprocessors to maximize performance. Along the way, you will spend time in the lab, designing real hardware, and later in the course you will apply your recently-acquired knowledge of quantitative computer architecture to analyse a simulated system and optimize its performance.         This new course presents a logical re-factoring of a sub-set of the material previously contained in the UG3 Computer Architecture and Computer Design courses. The aim of this course is to give students a comparatively deep understanding of computer architecture, to an intermediate level, together with a solid understanding of techniques used to design the logical building blocks from which a computer is constructed. We consider an intermediate level in computer architecture to extend up to the point where students have a good understanding of instruction set architecture, single-issue in-order pipelined execution of instructions, superscalar out-of-order execution, and the memory hierarchies required by those processors. Within a processor, we explore the principles and practice of arithmetic and logic unit design, of the caches from which memory hierarchies are constructed, and the memory and logic gate technologies from which computers are constructed. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on the Quantitative Approach to computer architecture; this informs not only the theoretical topics but also the practical assignments, which always embody some element of the quantitative approach.  The philosophy of this course is that learning about computer architecture is particularly effective if reinforced by implementing key aspects of processor design, in real hardware when feasible, but also at higher levels of abstraction using simulated systems. This approach has been used very effectively in the previous Computer Design and Computer Architecture courses, and feedback often cites the value placed on the lab exercises by students.

Students will gain experience in how to: - Schedule their work load - Design clearly and coherently structured systems - Discover and use relevant technical information - Implement a large-scale software system - Design and run experiments and tests - Analyse and report results - Present their work in a clear and concise way.         The Informatics Large Practical gives students experience in developing a non-trivial software system and reporting on the end product. In this way, the practical provides an introduction to the issues and requirements of the more demanding fourth-year project. In particular, the student gains practical experience of:  - Reading technical material and identifying the important content - Identifying and formalising project requirements - Identifying computational problems and inventing algorithmic solutions - Constructing a detailed design which does not over-commit to implementation detail - Implementing and testing a software application which realises the design - Experimenting with the implementation to explore the solutions to the computational problems - Writing a report which documents the solutions and the implementation - Managing a software project using a source-code repository.

Its more specific aim is to provide a route into more advanced uses of theorem proving in order to solve problems in mathematics and formal verification.  Major emphases are on: how knowledge can be represented using propositional, first-order and higher-order logic; how these representations can be used as the basis for reasoning, and how these reasoning processes can be guided to a successful conclusion through a variety of means ranging from fully-automated to interactive ones. Students will develop a thorough understanding of modern, interactive theorem proving via lectures, tutorials and an assignment.    *This course has replaced Automated Reasoning (Level 11) (INFR11074) from 2015/16.*         The course starts with an introduction to higher order logic, theorem provers and, more specifically, Isabelle/HOL. This will set the context for the rest of the course in which Isabelle will be the framework for getting hands-on experience about the application of various theoretical concepts. Through the lectures and tutorials that incorporate practical exercises the students will gain the skills needed to get started with Isabelle and progress to more complex concepts involving both representation and reasoning.  The second part will look at representation/modelling of concepts in (higher order) logic in details.  Axiomatic versus conservative extensions of theories will be covered and mechanisms such as Isabelle locales will be introduced and used. Recursive definitions and inductive notions will be covered too.  The third part of the course will focus on fundamental notions such as unification and rewriting, within both a first and higher order context. It will look at notions such as termination and use Isabelle's simplifier as the tool for understanding many of the concepts. It will also look at the interplay between (fully) automatic and interactive proofs.  The fourth part will introduce declarative/structured proofs and using the Isar language of Isabelle show how proofs resembling pencil and paper ones can be formalized.  Finally the various strands will brought together through the discussion of a non-trivial case study. This may involve either formalized mathematics (e.g. looking at a geometric theory) or a formal verification example.  The assignment will be a combination of basic to intermediate representation and reasoning in Isabelle (up to 40%), more advanced proof tackling one particular domain or example (up to 40%) and a final part which, if completed successfully, will clearly demonstrate that the student has a good of the challenges that advanced interactive theorem proving entails.

The course covers probability theory, considers the notion of random variables and vectors, how they can be manipulated, and provides an introduction to estimation theory.

While these problems can be solved using deterministic numerical methods, the course introduces Monte Carlo techniques which are the basis of powerful stochastic optimisation and integration algorithms. These methods rely on being able to sample numbers, or variates, from arbitrary distributions. This course will therefore discuss the various techniques which are necessary to understand these methods and, if time permits, techniques for random number generation are considered.

PGEE11191,Postgrad (School of Engineering),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_pgee.htm,"The emerging discipline of ecological engineering is a response to the growing need for engineering practice to provide for human welfare while at the same time protecting the natural environment from which goods and services are drawn. Ecological engineering is the design of sustainable systems, consistent with ecological principles.  Focused towards Offshore Energy Infrastructure (OEI) projects, this course will incorporate five design principles to guide practical ecological engineering.  The principles are:  1. design consistent with ecological principles,  2. design for site-specific context, 3. maintain the independence of design functional requirements,  4. design for efficiency in energy and information, and 5. acknowledge the values and purposes that motivate design.   The course will include lectures, mini-projects and site visits, taking full advantage of the range of capabilities available within the consortium.          Eco-engineering starts from dedicated pre-project environmental monitoring, recognising key environmental values and the presence and resilience of sensitive systems at an early stage. The planning, consenting and consequent installation of Offshore Energy Infrastructure often requires detailed environmental studies prior to the installation, during installation and during the operation. Base line studies will inform potential environmental concerns and impacts, providing a thorough understanding and increase the overall value of the project both for nature, society and the project itself related to economics and profitability during operational lifetime. The inclusion of Eco-Engineering approaches allows the optimisation of project design and implementation of adaptive work methods with the objective to enhance habitat and ensure minimal impact whilst enhancing beneficial gains.     The course will prepare for Eco-Engineering processes relevant to Offshore Energy Infrastructure projects that are often placed in sensitive marine environments that ask for responsible and innovative project approaches. The approaches considered will need to enable minimising impacts in the broadest sense and compensating any residual negative effects, whilst enabling the realization of the infrastructure installation through an eco-friendly approach as part of the design, processes and choice of materials. The learning outcomes will focus towards eco-friendly and integrated design processes and choice of materials and sub-systems; as well as the consideration of the inclusion of stakeholders and decision-making processes (i.e. regulatory requirements).   The course will be designed to build in relevant examples of pilots and case studies and students will learn from real experience, and will be asked to create scenarios developing notional Offshore Energy Infrastructure developments applying an Eco-Engineering approach. Notional project scenarios will include e.g. the development of i) an offshore renewable energy test site, ii) an installation of an offshore wind farm, iii) ecological design for scour protection and revetments, iv) receptor-based instead of source-based limits approach to underwater sound. In each case three general levels of Eco-Engineering approaches will be considered: 1.Considerate, responsible execution of offshore installation;  2.Fundamental knowledge generation to inform about realistic environmental constrains; 3.Develop innovative techniques to add ecological value to the design of offshore infrastructure.

It involves a substantial design project that mimics the real-world feasibility design of a bridge in a civil engineering design consultancy. The project is run with the help of experienced senior bridge engineers, helping to ensure that graduating students have skills needed to work as engineers in their practices, appropriate for a student graduating with a BEng degree.         Structural Engineering Design Project 4 mimics the real-world design of a bridge in a civil engineering consultancy. Students work within design teams to carry out a feasibility study for a new bridge, involving all aspects of the design process from the initial concept through to detailed design. One of the principle aims of the project is to draw together subjects learnt during the degree programme, to remind students of methods that they have perhaps forgotten, and to make sure they could start work in a real design office.  As in any real design situation, however, it will also be necessary to learn new skills to tackle the project, and in this case that will involve self-led study of aspects of bridge engineering (including construction methods, costs, Eurocodes for bridge design, and computer analysis tools). The project has been developed over many years with the help of experienced senior bridge engineers, based on the skills that are needed by graduate engineers in their practices and upon the type of problem that an engineer needs to be able to tackle to become chartered.  The range and depth of tasks that students tackle will be appropriate to a BEng degree.  The project is split into two parts.  During the first week students work on the Outline Design for two different concepts, which will involve selecting the most appropriate design tools to explore and develop the designs. During the second week, students proceed with the Detailed Design of one of these solutions, and there are opportunities for members of the design team to focus on different aspects of the detailed design (such as examining safe construction methods, or detailed modelling of a specific aspect of the bridge).  The course runs full-time for the first two weeks of semester 2.  To help lead students through the task, the project is split in to three submission stages, with a series of structured briefing, presentation, and review sessions.  The timetable for these sessions is adjusted depending upon the availability of the industry experts who assist with the project, and will be confirmed at the start of the course. Typically:  WEEK 1 Monday am: Initial briefing and industry expert briefing.  Tuesday pm: Design Scheme Brainstorm.  Wednesday pm: Discussion session with Industry Expert.  Friday pm: presentation of outline designs and submission A (outline design, group work) due.    WEEK 2 Monday am:  Review meetings and Industry Expert briefing.  Monday pm: Review meetings  Friday pm: detailed design handover meetings and submission B (detailed design, group work).   Submission C involves individual reflection upon the design problem, due at the end of week 4.  Surgery hours will be arranged for each group to discuss with the course lecturer throughout the course duration.

It  takes  a  step back from the structural mechanics methods taught elsewhere in the curriculum, such as Structural Mechanics 2 and Structural Analysis 3, and examines  the  design philosophy behind these techniques.    For  example,  why  and  when  is  it  safe  to  make assumptions  and  simplifications  in design;  how  do  different structural  forms  carry  load;  which  structural  form  is  best  to meet  a  particular  functional  requirement?    Modern  trends  in structural  engineering  involve  using  materials  that  are  more brittle, or more prone to buckling, or lighter and thinner; what are  the  implications  of  these  modern  forms  for  structural design?   The  course  builds upon  the  analysis  methods  covered  in 2nd year and 3rd year, and is intended for any student intending to specialise in structural engineering, or any student who wants to  go  beyond  the  equations  or  software  that are  used  for general structural analysis and design.         This 10 credit lecture course involves 10 hours of lectures, 6 hours of example classes and 9 hours of tutorial sessions. The course topics (not necessarily in this order) include:  1.Limit-state design concepts for loading and strength.  2.Material versus structural behaviour: brittle behaviour, ductile behaviour, and instability. Plasticity theorems. Implications for structural analysis and design.  3.Structural form: axial force and bending dominated structures; curved line structures etc.; Understanding load paths in different structural forms.  4.Structural function and choice of structural form.  5.Modern developments in structural engineering, as examples of exploitations of materials and structural behaviours. For example, prestressed concrete; use of brittle fibre reinforced composites to reinforce or strengthen concrete; earthquake retrofitting, stainless steel construction; timber structures.

It provides students with experience of solving and communicating solutions to open-ended engineering problems that require compromise between competing criteria and priorities. It develops competence and confidence in communication skills including sketching, engineering drawings and oral presentation. It also introduces engineering tools such as basic CAD and spreadsheet skills via self-directed learning.         Engineers design things. The 'things' that engineers design range from mile-high skyscrapers to underwater vehicles, from flood prevention schemes for informal settlements, to wind turbines, from single use PPE for hospitals to 100-year city strategies. We design things that need to fit into and strengthen our existing infrastructure. Engineering, therefore, is fundamentally creative, and Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps develop the skills needed for Engineering Design.  A key aspect of design is that there are no single correct answers. It is relatively straightforward to come up with a solution that works; the challenge for a good designer is to come up with the 'best' solution. That is not straightforward: some solutions might be impractical or unsafe to build, some might use materials that cannot be found locally, some will be very expensive or poor aesthetically. Designers often work with incomplete information, a Client who changes their mind part way through the project, or contradicting requirements. Iteration is always needed to find the 'best' design solution.  Tools for Engineering Design 2 helps students develop a 'toolbox' of strategies for tackling open-ended design problems. The course introduces the challenges of iterative design through short group projects and tasks. The projects gradually build students' awareness of and confidence in tackling conceptual design problems, a thread that is fundamental through engineering degree programmes.   The course covers: - What is design? - Communication (drawings, group work, meetings, discussion) - Self-led learning exercises - Design, build, re-design project - Master planning project - Upgrade project - Reflection exercise on what you have learnt on this course.

We work on bridges, tunnels, railways, water supply systems, buildings and flood defences and help tackle many of the big challenges (such as population growth and climate change) that face society.  Civil engineering is a creative discipline that tackles complex problems, underpinned by theory, knowledge, and experience.  Civil Engineering 1 starts to develop your technical knowledge by describing theoretical tools that are essential to civil engineers. These include structural analysis (to understand how bridges and buildings stand up), together with methods that describe water, transport, fire, and construction. The course also introduces other tools required in the profession, including design, sustainability and ethics. During the course, students will tackle the design of a large scale hydropower scheme; during the first half of semester they will encounter some of the key ethical and planning issues associated with large scale civil infrastructure; during the second half of semester they will develop an engineering design for a hydropower scheme. These projects introduce the challenges of solving open-ended design problems, and the benefits of group work.         A. Behaviour of Solids and Structures  The behaviour of solid materials and how they react to load underpins all of structural engineering. The Structural engineering lectures will focus on. -Static equilibrium, force resolution, couples and moments (2D and 3D), overall stability. -Free body diagrams, internal forces and moments. -Application of free body diagrams to understand the forces within different types of structure (e.g. buildings, bridges, towers, dams). -Different types of structural form (beams, three-pin arches, suspension and cable-stayed structures). -An introduction to structural materials and assessment of structural strength (based on a simple maximum stress criteria).

CHEE08001,Chemical,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_chee.htm,"Chemical Engineering is concerned with the design and operation of chemical processes on an industrial scale. Such chemical processes have traditionally concentrated on bulk inorganic chemicals (e.g. fertilisers), polymers, solvents, dyestuffs and explosives, but are increasingly including speciality chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and biological systems.  This course gives an introduction to the design of such industrial processes, including chemical reactions and reactor design, energetics of chemical processes, determination of material and thermal flows within processes, phase equilibria and separation processes.  In so doing, it covers many of the principles involved in taking chemical processes from the bench/laboratory research scale to the construction and operation of modern commercial chemical plants.         This course comprises 4 lectures on process synthesis, 5 lectures on mass balances, 4 lectures on heat transfer, 4 lectures on reactors, 8 lectures on separations and 4 lectures on chemical engineering in practice. There are 11 tutorials to support these lectures.

It consists of two parts - a two-week block of microeconomics and a two-week block of macroeconomics. Topics to be covered in the first block (microeconomics) include consumption, production, uncertainty and strategic interaction. The topics in the second block (macroeconomics) cover the basics of national income and macroeconomic modelling; the determinants of long-run economic growth, inflation and unemployment; money and interest rates and the role and influence of economic policy.         This course is designed to develop a solid understanding of the core economic models and insights from intermediate microeconomics and intermediate macroeconomics in a four-week period. The course is structured as a combination of daily lectures and tutorials (exercise classes) with extra reading to prepare for each class. The workload is heavy and consistent, both to cover the material and to adapt students to the pace of a graduate course. The material covered in the first block (microeconomics) includes the basics of consumer and producer theory, general equilibrium, intertemporal choice, game theory, and asymmetric information. In the second block (macroeconomics) students will discover how economies grow, why some countries have high inflation while others maintain stable prices, and why all countries have positive unemployment rates and sometimes experience recessions.

This section comprises both procedures commonly recognised as good practice and issues for which there is - as yet - no clear consensus. Areas include ethical concerns involving human participants, motivation of subjects and statistical techniques.  * Strands of experimental research: The goals are twofold. First, to give students an overview of the literature in experimental finance and economics. Second, to enable students to identify promising areas for future experiments.

The course intends to provide students with strong understanding of the economic theories and analytical frameworks that are applied in the literature of environmental economics in general and climate change economics in particular. Bearing in mind that the course is targeted at students with little or no economics background, it will start with an introduction to the concepts of markets, markets¿ mechanisms and the efficient allocation of scarce resources. This part of the course constitutes the foundation for most of the subsequent topics. Then we will challenge this market¿s framework by introducing the concepts of externalities and markets failure, which are essentially the starting point of extending the standard economic analyses when it comes to environmental issues such as climate change. The course then moves to cover various topics from optimal policy choice (carbon taxes versus carbon markets versus hybrid mechanisms), to environmental valuation techniques and cost-benefit analysis. For the remainder of the course we will covers specialised topics such as interactions between climate change and technology policies as well as international climate change cooperation. The course then moves to cover contemporary topics related to recent science, economics and policy debates. For instance we will look at Prof. William Nordhaus¿ contribution to the literature (namely DICE model) for which he co-won the 2018 Economics Nobel Prize, and most importantly we will look at the criticism for his contribution. Other topics we shall address include Climate Change Discounting and Stern-Nordhaus discounting debate, the Economics of 1.5°C Climate Change, the Economics of Net Zero Emissions and the UK¿s potential carbon policy options post-Brexit. Finally, we will look at some contributions in ecological economics, the framework of which challenges the analytical framework currently dominant in the literature of environmental economics.  Despite the fact that the second half of the course is highly technical by nature, the approach followed in the class focuses on understanding the intuition of the models without looking at the maths, and most importantly building students¿ ability to think critically about various methodologies and models approaches and their shortcomings.  Overall, throughout the course we will mix economic theory and practical applications. By the end of the course, students should have strong understanding of all topics discussed, as well as be well equipped to explore new topics in the literature later in their careers or further studies.          Broad Aims To provide students with an in-depth understanding of: -The concepts of markets, markets failure, externalities, public goods and  property rights applied on environmental issues -Regulatory measures and policy instruments available to control environmental degradation resulting from economic activities -Cost-benefit analysis applied on environmental policies and projects -Environmental valuation techniques -a number of emerging and recent issues in the literature of the economics of climate change   Topics Covered May vary from year to year, are likely to be drawn from: 1.Introduction to the concepts of markets and their mechanisms 2.Welfare economics and the environment 3.Public goods and externalities 4.Property rights and Coase theorem 5.Environmental regulations 6.Policy instruments (Pigovian taxes, subsidies and permit trading) in details 7.Cost-benefit analysis 8.Environmental valuation: Reveal preferences techniques 9.Environmental valuation: Stated preferences techniques 10.Climate Change Agreements  11.Technological Transfers and Direct Technical Change 12.Climate Change Discounting: The Stern Review and its critiques 13.Climate Change and Non-markets Impacts 14.Climate Change Modelling: Computable General Equilibrium Models (CGM), Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), etc.  15.The Economics of Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C  16.The Economics of Catastrophes, Fat Tails and the Dismal Theorem 17.Sustainable Growth 18.Climate and Energy Policy Interaction 19.The Economics of Market Stability Reserve in the EU ETS 20.Integrating Carbon Markets 21.The Economics of Emission Removal Technologies and Geoengineering  The exact topics covered each year will be published at the beginning of the course with the possibility of some changes during the course.

This is a course in Bayesian econometrics with a focus on models used in empirical macroeconomics. It begins with a brief introduction to Bayesian econometrics, describing the main concepts underlying Bayesian theory and seeing how Bayesian methods work in the familiar context of the regression model. Computational methods are of great importance in modern Bayesian econometrics and these are discussed in in detail. Subsequently, the course shows how Bayesian methods are used with models which are currently popular in macroeconomics such as Vector Autoregressions (VARs), time-varying parameter VARs (TVP-VARs) and factor models. Empirical illustrations that show how these models can be used to address macroeconomic questions will be provided throughout the course.

The course will be divided into two main components as follows:    Component 1: The (Monetary) Economics of Bitcoin (Dr. Gronwald)  Two sessions; dates tbc  The virtual currency of Bitcoin emerged in 2008, developed by a group of anonymous programmers with the purpose to make possible online payments without involvement of a financial institution or other third parties. Bitcoin is the most popular virtual currency and received considerable attention from both the general public and academia, mainly due to the spectacular price behaviour, its general novelty value and certainly also extraordinary events and scandals related to Bitcoin. It does not come as a surprise that monetary theorists as well as central banks are particularly interested in this phenomenon. Among the themes under discussion are, for instance, whether or not Bitcoin has the ability to perform the functions required of a fiat money. In addition, there is a discussion on whether or not Bitcoin can disrupt existing monetary systems. Considerable attention is paid to the feature that the total number of Bitcoins is fixed: ""In the case of a 'wild success' of Bitcoins and the replacement of sovereign fiat currency it would not be possible to increase the supply of Bitcoins in concert with economic growth."" (Yermack, 2013).

In this course we will look at the standard models of political economy and time inconsistency. First we will look at the problems of lack of commitment in setting up inflationary targets by a Central Banks, and to the institutional and political frameworks that have been developed to minimize the problem. Secondly, we will look at the role of time inconsistency in fiscal policy. Specifically, we will spend a good share of the course looking at the problems of repayment and repudiation of public debt under different monetary environments. This is, when and why do governments repudiate debt? what is the cost of doing so? and, perhaps more importantly, what are the costs for society of not having the ability of committing to not repudiate the debt?

The course is intended for students who want to be professional economists or who want to go on to PhD study. It also is very relevant to those planning to work or research in finance and/or macroeconomics.   The class covers three key classes of model with a practical focus: state space models, nonlinear time series models and factor models. State space models are used for a wide variety of applications in macroeconomics and finance, including trend-cycle decompositions, modelling time-variation in parameters, ARMA modelling and estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Non-linear time series models (e.g. Markov switching or threshold autoregressive models) are used to model time-variation or regime change in parameters. Particularly with macroeconomic data, such parameter change is typically found and it is important to account for it when doing empirical work.  Factor methods are used to deal with Big Data that researchers in macroeconomics and finance are increasingly using. They reduce the information in large data sets into a small number of factors, allowing for parsimonious econometric analysis.   Taken together, knowledge of these three topics will provide the student with the ability to estimate and forecast with a wide range of important models and deal with empirically important issues that arise in them.

The first part of the syllabus is devoted to the Generalised Method of Moments or GMM.  GMM was introduced by Hansen (1982) and is now a key tool in the applied economist's toolbox.  GMM has a number of other attractive features: it accommodates problems and data structures that show up frequently in econometrics, such as endogeneity and causal effects, heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and time series and panel data; it often provides a way of linking priors from economic theory to specific estimation strategies; and it is flexible and extendable, i.e. various apparently complex estimation problems can be written down as simple GMM estimators. Other topics covered in this part of the course include specification testing in the GMM framework and the 'weak identification' problem and weak-identification-robust estimation.  The second part of the syllabus is devoted to selected advanced topics in econometrics.  These topics vary from year to year.

Each mathematical topic is explored in the context of an important economic problem.         The topics covered vary from year to year.  An example curriculum would be the following mathematics concepts illustrated in the context of general equilibrium theory:  * Naive Set Theory. This is the language of mathematics, and is widely used by economists. This is important for making precise hypotheses, such as ""in every equilibrium, real wages increase over time"", and for verifying these hypotheses with logically sound proofs. The main concepts are: sets, functions, logical connectives, quantifiers, countability, induction, proof by contradiction.  * Real Analysis and Metric Spaces. This branch of mathematics focuses on continuity and nearness (topology) while putting geometric concepts like distance and angles into the background. These ideas are useful for determining whether an optimal decision is possible, whether an equilibrium of an economy exists, and determining when optimal decisions change drastically when circumstances change. The main concepts are: open sets, continuity, limits, interior, boundary, closure, function spaces, sup metric, Cauchy sequences, connected spaces, complete spaces, compact spaces, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Banach fixed point theorem, Brouwer fixed point theorem.  * Convex Analysis. This branch of geometry focuses on comparing extreme points and intermediate points that lie between extremes. These tools are useful for determining whether there is one or several optimal decisions in a particular situation, and determining in which direction optimal choices move when circumstances change. Convex analysis is related to the economic notions of increasing marginal cost and decreasing marginal benefit. The main concepts are: convex sets, convex and concave functions, quasi-convex and quasi-concave functions, supporting hyperplane theorem, separating hyperplane theorem.  * Dynamic Programming. This branch of mathematics is about breaking up a complicated optimisation problem involving many decisions into many simple optimisation problems involving few decisions. For example, a lifetime of choices can be broken up into simple choices made day-by-day. The main concepts are: value functions, Bellman equations, Bellman operators.  * Envelope Theorem. This is a calculus formula for calculating marginal values, such marginal benefit of saving money. The main concepts are: differentiable support functions, the Benveniste-Scheinkman theorem.

ECNM10024,Economics,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_ecnm.htm,"Money plays an essential role in modern economies, but this essential role is not well-captured in standard macro models, which typically tack money on in a more or less arbitrary ad hoc way to a barter model of a competitive economy. The early part of the course takes a closer look at the role of money and the problem of how to model it seriously and, in the process, raises more general issues about the nature of economic models and how to interpret them. All this might sound like an arid and highly abstract academic exercise, but it is not. The limitations of standard models of money have an important bearing on practical and topical policy issues, which are the focus of the latter part of the course. The treatment of policy will focus primarily on the monetary policy framework, which has been at the centre of recent policy discussions among academics and practitioners. We will consider aspects of: the interplay between monetary and fiscal policy; monetary policy games, credibility and reputation; central bank independence; and monetary policy operating procedures. The course essay and teamwork mini-project provide opportunities to broaden the topics covered in class and/or explore topics in greater depth. Visiting undergraduate students, interested in taking the course, should consult the course instructor. Much of the reading for the course is advanced, taken from journal articles and graduate level textbooks. The course is aimed at the serious student, who is willing to grapple with difficult material, that is the focus of ongoing research activity. The reward, for those who grapple, is insight into important issues in monetary economics, including recent and current research activity and policy debates.         Topics covered may include:  1.General introduction; modelling money - some general issues  2.Three standard models of money: OLG, CIA, and MIU 3.Shopping time and search-theoretic models 4.Money, growth and super-neutrality 5.Anticipated inflation and welfare costs 6.

Second, it looks at the internal organisation of the firm and the interactions among workers within it (e.g. the role of incentives, the effect of managers or the importance of social interactions between co-workers).         The course combines theoretical models, that allow us to explain and predict the behaviour of decision makers, with empirical applications from the literature that demonstrate the existence and relevance of these theoretical mechanisms in practice.    The first part of the course starts by discussing the theory behind the pricing and production decisions of firms that have some type of market power (e.g. monopoly and price differentiation strategies, oligopoly, product differentiation, collusion and cartels). This is followed by a discussion of welfare considerations and practical issues on measuring market power and regulation of non-competitive markets. Finally, this part studies some problems inherent to upstream-downstream markets such as vertical integration and double marginalisation.

The focus is specifically on the role of three broadly defined sectors and their main characteristics: agriculture, industry and services. Throughout, the course emphasises the empirical application of simple theoretical models.         Economies vary systematically in the type of goods that they produce. This course sheds light on the sources of the variation in sectoral composition and how sectors in turn affect economic development. For example: are poor economies underdeveloped because they have high agricultural employment or does the high agricultural employment result from their low level of development?   The course relies on recent theoretical contributions and empirical evidence in the subject to cover the following topics: Demand- versus supply-driven factors behind structural transformation; The agricultural productivity and wage gap; Spatial characteristics of rural versus urban production; Sectoral interdependencies through intermediate and capital goods; Tradeable versus non-tradable goods; Factors of production in fixed versus non-fixed supply; Differences in human capital intensity across sectors; The substitutability between market and home services; The role of technology and skill-biased technical change in development and structural transformation.

The first part, taught by Dr Jonas Cederlöf, will cover time series methods, focusing on regressions with trending variables, testing and correcting for serially correlated errors, as well as forecasting. The second part, taught by Dr Andreas Steinhauer, covers techniques for working with panel data, instrumental variables estimation, and limited dependent variable models. Applications include both instructions on how to employ these methods to data that are freely available and examining journal articles which use these methods. Students will have the opportunity to carry out their own empirical modelling and estimation, developing skills expected of contemporary economics graduates in a wide variety of contexts.

Each mathematical topic is explored in the context of an important economic problem.         The topics covered vary from year to year.  An example curriculum would be the following mathematics concepts illustrated in the context of general equilibrium theory:   * Naive Set Theory.  This is the language of mathematics, and is widely used by economists.  This is important for making precise hypotheses, such as ""in every equilibrium, real wages increase over time"", and for verifying these hypotheses with logically sound proofs.  The main concepts are: sets, functions, logical connectives, quantifiers, countability, induction, proof by contradiction.   * Real Analysis and Metric Spaces.  This branch of mathematics focuses on continuity and nearness (topology) while putting geometric concepts like distance and angles into the background.  These ideas are useful for determining whether an optimal decision is possible, whether an equilibrium of an economy exists, and determining when optimal decisions change drastically when circumstances change.  The main concepts are: open sets, continuity, limits, interior, boundary, closure, function spaces, sup metric, Cauchy sequences, connected spaces, complete spaces, compact spaces, Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, Banach fixed point theorem, Brouwer fixed point theorem.   * Convex Analysis.  This branch of geometry focuses on comparing extreme points and intermediate points that lie between extremes.  These tools are useful for determining whether there is one or several optimal decisions in a particular situation, and determining in which direction optimal choices move when circumstances change.  Convex analysis is related to the economic notions of increasing marginal cost and decreasing marginal benefit. The main concepts are: convex sets, convex and concave functions, quasi-convex and quasi-concave functions, supporting hyperplane theorem, separating hyperplane theorem.   * Dynamic Programming.  This branch of mathematics is about breaking up a complicated optimisation problem involving many decisions into many simple optimisation problems involving few decisions.  For example, a lifetime of choices can be broken up into simple choices made day-by-day.  The main concepts are: value functions, Bellman equations, Bellman operators.   * Envelope Theorem.  This is a calculus formula for calculating marginal values, such marginal benefit of saving money.  The main concepts are: differentiable support functions, the Benveniste-Scheinkman theorem.

We will address its implications, from a positive as well as from a normative point of view. Thus, after showing that citizens show pro-social preferences in their market behaviour (e.g., as consumers or shareholders), we will study its effect on product market competition. When doing so, we will consider a crucial aspect with regards to the so called socially responsible firm practices, namely, the level of market transparency. CSR not only concerns consumers, but also other firm stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, shareholders and other financiers, and we will also pay attention to them in our analysis.  Then, we will discuss corporate governance in light of corporate social responsibility, as well as the interaction that CSR (sometimes also called self-regulation) has with the more traditional way society usually has dealt with firm behaviour, namely, formal regulation. Then, we will also study and discuss some industry and firm case studies, including the role of CSR in the current climate change crisis.

CMSE11461,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"Students will approach the course with varying degrees of own understanding of the word 'resilience'. Many of them may have held or still hold professional positions which include 'resilience' in their title. In most cases, students are likely to have approached or experienced resilience from a single perspective; for instance, they may be working in an engineering role, or again in a risk management role, or in business continuity planning and management, or else.  The USER course will provide a broad view of resilience, moving on from the intra-personal resilience dimension of 'resilient individuals' that is typical of fields such as clinical psychology, all the way up a sequence of more and more complex settings revolving around inter-personal resilience. These include, to cite the most commonly mentioned: resilience of teams and organisations, resilience of supply chains and industrial networks, or of other complex networks such as intermodal transport networks, resilience of complex systems and major infrastructure (e.g. major bridges, high-speed rail projects), resilience of communities, cities and rural spaces, and resilience of economies, entire nations and supranational organisations (e.g. the European Union). In many respects, major programmes fall under several of these categories/groupings for which resilience constitutes a relevant aspect, e.g. a major programme undoubtedly has also a clear dimension as an organisation (see e.g. Crossrail, or HS2).  The underlying assumption at the basis of the USER course is that the analysis and the subsequent enhancement of the resilience of any of the above example settings is per se a complex, problematic, poorly understood (to start with) problem situation, the understanding of which is unlikely to take place solely on the basis of (hard) data available at hand. Resilience analysis and enhancement, in fact, is not the only case of a situation that is dominated by complexity, conflicting interests and views by various stakeholder groups, uncertainty of the related parameters, and potential turbulent, unpredictable behavioural patterns of evolution over time. Situations of this kind are often called 'messes' or 'wicked problems', and a number of techniques have been developed in the past half a century to deal with them, to support end-to-end journeys that go from the development of a deep understanding of any such problem situation, its structuring in a form that starts to be amenable to meaningful analysis, and finally to the testing and choice of potential enhanced alternative settings that improve the problem situation (e.g. the overall resilience of an organisation, or its resilience against specific disruptive events and crises).  In the USER course, students will learn a tested method to study and improve the resilience of anything they may be concerned with. The method is agnostic to the application sector, the type of industry or problem considered, and promotes the integration of qualitative and quantitative analysis around resilience-related problem situations.                  Over the last decade, the term 'resilience' has been widely adopted in a multitude of different contexts and for virtually uncountably many different purposes, to the point that its true meaning might have gone, in part, lost. One of the reasons for that, may be the prompt adoption of the word by fields such as risk management, business continuity management, etc., largely for re-branding purposes. This course will initially take students on a brief historical journey, tracing back the development of resilience through both the sciences and humanities, but also touching upon the legal and political spheres. By the end of this journey, the commonalities and differences in the interpretations of the term 'resilience' from the different fields of adoption will be highlighted and, with them, the multi-faceted nature of resilience as such.  The course will then accompany the student on a step-by-step process of resilience analysis and enhancement, working on real problem situations that will include the students' own projects, equipped with which they joined their programme (LMP, or other UEBS programmes) or pathway at EFI. The method presented in the course takes its roots from a number of partly related fields such as Operational Research/Management Science, Systems Thinking, Cybernetics, Problem Structuring Methods and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis.     In the first step of the process, students will learn how to involve and guide the 'most relevant' group of people in a sequence of facilitated workshops, through which resilience-related issues from the given problem situation will be raised.   During the second step of the process, students will get to know potential recipes for resilience enhancement, something that in the literature goes by the name of 'resilience attributes'.   In the third step, students will learn how to devise a discrete subset of the list of resilience attributes that most likely enhances the resilience of the problem situation. More precisely, students will learn how to derive a (short) list of strategic options to be considered in the redesign of the problem situation, together with the related systems, processes, organisational structures, etc.   In the final step, students will learn how to analyse and compare the strategic options on the basis of their performance, and to choose one to pursue and turn into an actual intervention/change to be rolled out. Students will first learn how to devise the important subset of multiple criteria of performance that apply to the problem situation being studied. Some of these criteria will be specifically related to resilience performance; these include time-based resilience indices as well as cross-sectional resilience synthetic indicators. Example quantitative techniques to be used to collect data, compute the specific performance metrics and ultimately choose the 'best' candidate strategic option will also be discussed.  Outline Content -Etymology of Resilience -Resilience Attributes -Resilience Design Principles -The Resilience Landscape and Process -Time-based Resilience Indices -Cross-sectional Synthetic Indicators for Resilience   Student Learning Experience The course blends a strong theoretical and methodological (inter-disciplinary) background, with a strong practical emphasis. Attendance is compulsory because, building on from the morning lectures, the afternoon workshops will see students working in groups on real problem situations, experiencing the different steps of the resilience analysis and enhancement process first hand, and exchanging roles with one another in each step, so that the different challenges arising from both the problem owner and the analyst sides can be understood. Following on from this student experience in the classroom, each student will be able to focus efforts on their final, individual coursework, and demonstrate, through it, that they are by then equipped with the resilience analysis and enhancement toolkit.

The course aims to support an understanding of business because macroeconomics affects all companies through: level of demand for products; interest rates - with their effect on the costs of the firm; and the exchange rate - which tends to intensify or reduce competition even for firms not overtly engaged in trade. Each of these elements interact both with themselves and with other factors, such as government policy.

Section one - which explores the socio-cultural meaning of brands - is designed to equip students with an understanding of what a brand is, how they are used by consumers and from where their meaning is derived. This will be done by exploring a range of contemporary theories from marketing and , sociology. With this grounding in place, we then move in section two to explore the concepts of brand equity before discussing different approaches to the management of brands. Learning is guided through consideration of the relevant literature and real-life examples from a variety of sectors.         Aims, Nature, Context   This course offers students the opportunity to study and understand a fundamental marketing technology. Brands are considerable vehicles for cultural meaning, self-expression, community, social movement and communication. Increasingly, for better or worse, the logic of brands and branding can be seen in diverse areas of life, beyond consumer goods - e.g. the political brand, branded religion and person as brand. In short, our daily lives are saturated by brand messages and meaning.  From this backdrop we will explore the ways in which brands create value for organisation and consumers alike.

CMSE12001,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"This course introduces the context in which entrepreneurship and innovation happens. Ever since the early work of Schumpeter, the concepts of entrepreneurship and innovation have been strongly related. Schumpeter famously talks about 'gales of creative destruction' which entrepreneurs unleash by introducing radically different products, services and processes to the marketplace, thereby challenging the status quo and disrupting industry incumbents.    However, although there are many connections between innovation and entrepreneurship, they are distinct concepts. We know that not all entrepreneurs innovate, indeed, the majority of new, independent venture are not innovative at all. The real question here is thus not whether entrepreneurs innovate, but rather when and where they do so. This question really calls the attention to the importance of understanding the context of innovative activity by entrepreneurs, which is the focus of this overview sessions.         Aims, Nature, Context   The programme welcomes students with non-business training, as well as professionals who seek an in-depth understanding of entrepreneurial practices and innovation dynamics. This introductory course will provide them with a basic understanding (in both theory and practice) of these notions, and place them in the context of core courses and electives offered. It will discuss the macro and micro contexts of entrepreneurship and innovation and outline the themes and topics to be explored through core and elective courses. It will explore the contexts within which entrepreneurship and innovation take place and the challenges organisations face, be they public, private or third sector).    Syllabus   The role of context in entrepreneurship and innovation management (micro and macro level)   Student Learning Experience   The course will involve one session. The students are expected to engage in small group discussion to tackle different issues pertaining to variations in social, economic and cultural contexts.

CMSE11090,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"A fundamental outcome of entrepreneurship is the creation of new value, usually through the creation of new products and services which may lead to the creation of a new business entity. The objective of this course is to demonstrate and understand that exploiting a new opportunity is a process that can be planned, resourced, and managed. To start a successful business, an entrepreneur must exercise motivation as well as enterprising and managerial skills. He or she requires access to resources to grow the business; not just investment but social resources as well. Overall success is not just related to the nature of market opportunities but to the entrepreneurial and managerial motivations and skills of the entrepreneur.          The course demonstrates the relevance of entrepreneurship in large organisations and analyses how it can be integrated into more familiar approaches of corporate management. Many large firms have to react to new market opportunities, and have to develop mechanisms to develop new products and services. Many of these new lines of value arise from the activities of entrepreneurs within the organisation (intrapreneurs) or through the vision of entrepreneurial senior managers or leaders. New companies commonly spin out of large organisations. How larger firms can encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, and yet retain control, remains a major challenge to modern companies. The need to be entrepreneurial is also strong in modern, large, non-business organisations. Many are forced to raise more funds as their existing public funds are insufficient. There is also recognition that governments cannot underpin all good causes. This has motivated many caring entrepreneurs to start charities of their own, some of which from small beginnings have grown into major world organisations. Social entrepreneurship has become an important field of management in recent years. The course includes an introduction to entrepreneurship and business venturing and also examines entrepreneurial managerial processes associated with identification, resources, and management of opportunity exploitation. The course also examines how entrepreneurial organisations can be created, enhanced, managed and resourced. The course will also emphasise the importance of entrepreneurial management styles and techniques in both small and large organisations. The knowledge learnt will enable students to critically examine and question more traditional approaches to the study of management.  Syllabus: -What is entrepreneurial management? -Informal identification and discussion of entrepreneurial organizations -Innovation and Creativity at entrepreneurial organizations -Individual vs. organizational innovation -Family business -Social and sustainable entrepreneurship -Entrepreneurial growth strategies -Opportunity recognition and opportunity assessment -Entrepreneurial finance -Entrepreneurial culture and leadership -Corporate Entrepreneurship and Strategic Venturing  Student Learning Experience: This course utilises multiple learning modes, including: independent reading, primary research, lecture, group discussion, case studies, and exposure to practice. Though guided by lectures, students will gain knowledge and understanding through reading and desk research. The wide availability of secondary information in print and online, combined with the opportunity to interact with active entrepreneurs, enables students to gain understanding of core issues. Students are expected to assess the implications of research on best practice from multiple sources, including lectures, readings, web-based resources, and the experiences of active entrepreneurs. Guidance from lectures should develop understanding to some degree, but discussions during course sessions and within the group projects are equally or even more important. Most sessions contain opportunities for group discussion and reflection, particularly on cases illustrating various aspects of good and bad practice.

The course also seeks to develop a greater awareness of their personal goals, motivations, strengths and limitations in the context of venture creation and growth, particularly in the context of forming new ventures or joining a new young venture. The course provides opportunities for students to learn from each other, from practitioners in the field and from the latest theories/concepts on the topic. The course requires students to work in groups to create a coherent and viable business concept which will be presented to an external panel in the last class session. Whilst the frameworks and concepts learned are applicable in a start-up venture situation, most are as applicable when identifying and developing new activities within a larger organisational setting.  Syllabus: New venture creation  and the Feasibility Study The Business Idea: Opportunity recognition and evaluation  Industry and Competitor analysis, developing an effective business model Operationalising and resourcing the business; accessing support Finalising the plan and pitching it to potential investors  Student Learning Experience: This course provides students with the opportunity to develop a deeper theoretical and practical understanding of the new venture creation process and the role which the entrepreneur plays within that process. Working in groups, students are required to apply that knowledge through development of a new venture plan where the group identifies a new venture opportunity and develop a business plan for the exploitation of that opportunity. The group pitches that opportunity to a panel of business experts at the end of the course.

Lectures will first introduce the student to the main aspects of running a simulation project, and then proceed to discuss selected details such as input and output data analysis.  During computer labs, students will learn and use a commercial simulation package, and focus on Discrete Event Simulation modelling and analysis of simple examples.          Academic Description This course deals with the various aspects that are related to the planning and running of a simulation project, within the broader context of Prescriptive Analytics and, more generally, Business Analytics. Of all simulation methods available, the course will focus on the most widely used of them, i.e. 'Discrete Event Simulation'. The Basics of Probability and Statistics that are needed to successfully apply simulation are, albeit already covered in Semester 1 courses, briefly reminded to the student in the earlier sessions of this course. The reason is that those basics need to be put in the context of simulation modelling and analysis, something which requires a shift of mindset from the part of the student in the way they think about basic techniques such as those for building confidence intervals. The course then covers all main aspects related to the inclusion of random (stochastic) elements in simulation models, namely: random number generation, random variate generation and input data analysis. Finally, the course discusses techniques for the analysis of output data from simulation runs, including the analysis of a single system and, more importantly, the comparison of multiple system alternative configurations in order to choose the 'best' course of action for a given business problem.

Amidst rapid technological change, digital services are becoming a key element of modern business and entrepreneurship, and drivers of economic development.  Yet, there are major challenges to, and opportunities for, effective services management: firstly, services are a heavily heterogeneous field, ranging from culture and leisure to hospitality, retail, professional and financial services; while this provides fertile ground for services innovation across sectors, managers have a tendency to over-emphasise differences and 'uniqueness' within their on services areas. Secondly, an orthodox product-dominant modus of management prevails within most organisations  and within business education; service-dominant theories, such as co-creation and co-production of value in services, provide managers with the opportunity to differentiate themselves and their organisations.

This requires them to understand the nature of services, what constitutes 'value' (for the organisation, staff, customers and other stakeholders) and contemporary approaches to service design.     The course will provide a common lecture series and will focus on three key areas:    the nature of services and the service systems within which they are delivered;    the multi-dimensional nature of value and the processes through which it is created within a service context;    the design of services to support value creation.   These online lectures will be supplemented by a tutorial series customised to the needs of each programme that it is part of.         The course introduces students to the design and delivery of services within complex and dynamic service systems.  It will draw upon service management theory and research to provide students with the teaching and learning they require to operate successfully in service environments.   The course will consider what a 'service' is, focusing particularly on its experiential dimension and the complexity of the systems within which services are designed and delivered.  In doing so, it will introduce contemporary models of service design and delivery which situate the customer as a key actor within the value creation process.  The course will also consider the multi-dimensional nature of value and the processes through which it can be created or destroyed during service production for various stakeholders, including the service organisation and its customers.      Outline Content   The lecture series will focus on the following areas:   Understanding services   Exploring the nature of value and the processes of value creation   Value creation within complex service systems   Designing service excellence    Service design methods for creativity, innovation and improvement   Student Learning Experience   This course will be delivered online through the virtual learning environment Learn.  Students will have access to the recorded lecture series delivered by UEBS staff. This will be supplemented by various online resources, which will be used to support active learning and will be tailored and contextualised to discrete service areas.  These components may include a mixture of online tutorials, case study resources, examples and 'talking head' videos, depending on the specific needs of each programme area.   For the development of this part of the course, UEBS may seek specialist advice from each programme area.   Discussion forums will be used as a tool for class discussions on the content provided in the lecture series and other resources to share knowledge and experience among learners.

This course is intended to complement other finance courses that are mainly based on the traditional paradigm which assumes that investors and managers are generally rational. We aim to examine how the insights of behavioural finance theories shed light on the behaviour of individual investors and finance professionals in the context of investment and corporate finance decision-making. We also explore the possibility to improve investment performance by recognising the cognitive biases and applying appropriate de-biasing techniques.

Students will engage in a small sized project and develop hands-on experience of managing a project life cycle. In addition, they will develop team management and leadership skills.          Academic Description  Project management and business analysis represent two elements that are key to the success of any business endeavour. Project managers are in charge of ensuring that a project is completed on time and within the planned budget. Business analysts must focus on the product of the project ensuring that it meets the needs of the key stakeholders.  In this course, we introduce the project management life cycle and we compare selected state-of-the-art life cycle models for effective project management, such as traditional, agile and extreme project management; we also introduce selected state-of-the-art tools for effective project management, such as PERT and CPM.  We also provide an overview of business analysis activities throughout the life of a project such as stakeholder analysis, requirement analysis, risk analysis, business process and data analysis, implementation, validation, deployment and assessment. For these, we introduce a toolbox of selected state-of-the-art business analysis tools such as mind maps, use case diagrams, business process diagrams etc.  Operating within a given budget necessarily imposes choices in terms of which stakeholder requests should be given priority. Project managers and business analysts must therefore coordinate their plans to ensure that budget is not exceeded and key stakeholders are satisfied. Furthermore, as the project progresses, delays and other unforeseen events may impose a sudden re-planning of on-going activities. The exact nature of this re-planning should also be defined in concert. In some cases, reaching a consensus in the project team may constitute an extremely challenging task. To deal with these issues, we illustrate the basics of group dynamics and strategies that a team can adopt to work together effectively.  The objective of this course is then to: 1. provide an introduction to established project management and business analysis techniques, such as traditional, agile and extreme project management;  2. illustrate selected state-of-the-art tools typically adopted in the context of project management and business analysis;  3. illustrate group dynamics issues typically encountered in the context of project management.

This course will consider these principles in the management of all types project with particular emphasis on engineering projects, with respect to the project's life-cycle, the parties involved, planning, estimating, risk management, contract management, and project control. The course will examine the context of these themes through the development of a project execution plan based on a real project.         This course takes a managerial approach to project management. Many of the tools and techniques used to run projects in the modern context have been around for some time and there is a large body of professional knowledge that captures project management practice; for example through the AMP, PMI and PRINCE2 methodology. However there are many instances of project failure, many of which are reported in the national press.   This course aims to make students aware of the commonly available tools used to run projects are, so the course introduces project lifecycle, stakeholder management, planning and control, estimating, risk management and closing projects down as subjects. However the course takes a reflective look at these approaches and asks students to consider whether what makes some projects successful and others not. If these tools have been around for such a long time, why are projects so risky and prone to cost overruns, expanded timescales and a failure to deliver against the stated objectives? If we can understand this we can learn from project failure and build better and more robust practice.

CMSE11507,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"The course aims to equip participants with the adequate tools and principles to design effective governance systems and procedures (both formal and informal) in the context of major programmes, which are characterised by a high degree of complexity and uncertainty. Participants will develop a critical attitude towards common and conventional forms of governance based on the ideals such as alignment, agreement and shared objectives, overcome an unjustified faith in the power of incentives to orient people's behaviour and acquire skills on how to engage project and programme team members, make them explore, debate and deliberate on complex matters which are difficult to be quantified. They will also gain a critical understanding of risk management and develop alternative forms of delivering programmes in risky environments.         Academic Description The course will provide a critical understanding of current governance systems and practices to (including board composition) to equip managers with practical tools to govern ambiguity, complexity and the management of unknown-unknowns in decision-making processes. It draws on theories developed in organisation theory, science and technology studies, and rhetoric blending them in ways that equip students to manage governance challenges in formal and informal settings.  At the end of the course, participants are expected to:  -Understand the limitations of rational-choice approaches in designing governance systems and be able to implement alternative forms which prove effective in managing risk in major programmes; -Critically assess the use in practice and limitations of corporate governance models and whether they are adequate or not to manage risk and uncertainty in major programmes; -To design formal and informal incentive systems that drive behaviours that are coherent with the degree of uncertainty of major programmes; -Explore the informal aspects of governance systems and practices, including the design of space facilities and meeting rooms; -Be aware of the organisational, political and social role that performance measurement and risk management systems play when governing major programmes.  Outline Content The first sessions are dedicated to introduce the overall themes of the course, its structure, the role of the participants in class and, above all, the approach followed in treating issues of governance under situations of risk and uncertainty, especially in relation to large organisations and megaprojects. It will help participants to deconstruct their common understanding of project and programme management in order to elaborate alternative forms of governance systems and practices.  These sessions are then followed by the discussion and operationalisation of principles which will help design governance systems that will serve as instrument of mediation of tensions, exploration of uncertainties, and engagement. Specifically, we will look at how governance systems and practices can act as effective communication and integration tools, leading to a more effective management of risk and uncertainty.  The remaining sessions of the course will explore how to build effective governance systems (including board composition and working) in situations of ambiguity and uncertainty and help participants to develop a critical attitude towards corporate governance approaches that underestimate the role of organisational politics and contextual variables in decision-making in organisations.   Student Learning Experience The course combines traditional lecturing, with case study discussion and workshops with group work and peer learning. The course requires students to prepare the cases to be discussed before class. It is envisaged that each case requires two hours of preparation. The course is run more along the lines of an executive education course than a conventional MSc class. This is in line with recent innovations in the delivery of business education at the post-graduate level which sees the increasing importance of group activities within settings that are more similar to a workshop than a traditional front lecture. The combination of lecturing with supervised workshop and outside class work also enables an effective combination of abstract academic knowledge with the enhancement of practical skills. More generally, a good combination of lecturing and active student participation avoids loss of attention and helps focusing.

This course will provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand the social, political/regulatory, and technological causes of these developments, as well as their impacts on financial markets and broader society.         Financial markets are continually transformed through the development of new financial products, services, and technologies. While FinTech represents the latest wave of financial innovation, earlier decades saw the development of swaps and options, exchange-traded funds, mortgage securitization, algorithmic trading, as well as novel risk management techniques such as portfolio insurance. This course is designed to provide students studying on the Finance, Technology and Policy MSc programme with the knowledge and skills necessary to critically examine both the social, political, and technological drivers of financial innovation, as well as the consequences of financial innovation on markets, institutions, and broader society. The course addresses these topics first by studying a number of historical episodes of financial innovation as well as current FinTech developments through an interdisciplinary lens. Thus, while the course is grounded in the economics literature on financial innovation, it also draws on concepts and theories from strategic management, economic sociology, and science and technology studies. At the end of the course, we will apply these perspectives to present-day developments in the FinTech space.   Outline Content  1.What is financial innovation? Perspectives from economics, management, and sociology 2.Financial innovation as the development of new financial instruments: swaps, derivatives and the emergence of 'off-balance sheet' finance 3.Financial innovation as the development of new calculative practices: FICO, the Gaussian Copula, and the 2008 financial crisis 4.Financial innovation as the development of new forms of market infrastructure: the growth of automated trading and the transformation of equity markets 5.Financial innovation in the present-day: the case of FinTech        ","Perspectives on Financial Innovation: Markets, Technologies, and Policies",http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxcmse11496.htm

These new approaches include 3rd sector organisations (social enterprises, low-profit corporations, co-operatives, community interest corporations, benefit corporations and other forms) as well as hybrid networks of government, industry and 3rd sector organisations Effectively taking on these social and environmental issues however, requires a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of these problems and how designing and implementing solutions can pose specific challenges in terms of organisational design, management and oversight. This course seeks to provide students with greater insight into those challenges through a critical re-evaluation of social issues and case studies of innovative responses. Students will take these concepts and apply them to their choice of grand challenge projects [n.b. This is a 20 credit variant of CMSE11346 that will run alongside this course and as been developed for students on non-Business School programmes].         Aims, Nature, Context   3rd sector organisations (social enterprises, co-operatives, charities, trusts, etc.) are increasingly relied upon as catalysts for addressing difficult social and environmental issues. The aim of this course is to develop student knowledge and understanding about the strategic and governance related challenges faced by these organisations and their role within the hybrid networks that do the work of social innovation. In this course, students will gain a broader and deeper theoretical and contextual understanding of current and future opportunities and challenges faced by these organisations and networks. The focus of the course is the development of transferable skills directly applicable to social innovation organisations and networks through a range of multimedia resources and a hands-on  project with a range of host organisations.   Syllabus    This course will be structured around the following content:  1. Why social innovation? The history and context of the role of 3rd sector organisations and social innovation in building and reinforcing civil society and democratic norms. What are the current and future trends within the 3rd sector?    2. Assessing social value. What are the means by which we can measure ideas such as social capital and social impact? What are the implications of how we measure and how we frame these issues for communicating with crucial organisational stakeholders.    3. Spatial inequality. How are poverty and social deprivation related to the shape of our built environment? Are there ways of creating urban spaces that are more equitable and safer for all?    4. Complex systems and systems thinking. Social problems are invariably embedded in complex systems. Developing effective responses requires an understanding of this complexity through conceptual tools such as systems thinking  5. Technology and inequality. Technology can bring us together as well as divide us. What is the role of algorithms for example in creating and reinforcing a digital divide between those who are privileged and those who are not?    Student Learning Experience   This course will consist of several major components:    i) Lectures: To provide students with a theoretical and practical understanding of challenges faced by 3rd sector organisations through active discussion of theoretical multi-disciplinary concepts and case studies that provide insight into we can respond to social and environmental issues.   ii) Blended learning: Course content is primarily delivered online via Learn, in the form of readings and videos, and short online quizzes to reinforce comprehension in advance of lectures.    iii) Groupwork: Each student will work in groups to do a project based on a grand societal challenge.

Expertise in this area (negotiation) leads to the crafting of better deals, helps manage teams and projects more efficiently, and facilitates the successful conduct of client and employee relations.   This course offers useful and effective theoretical insights into the negotiation process. It also provides practical tools that can be used in a range of everyday situations. While the in-class exercises cover such apparently simple situations as buying a car or negotiating one's salary, the skills highlighted here are generally applicable in real-world situations of substantially greater commercial significance.  These situations include determining the terms and conditions of one's individual employment; negotiating commercial contracts; corporate take-overs; union-management agreements; setting regulatory conditions; determining the location of an environmentally hazardous facility; and in resolving commercial disputes with third party intervention (mediation and arbitration). The negotiation situations under discussion and the in-class negotiation exercises start out as simple two party single-issue situations.  These grow in complexity with an increased number of 'issues on the table' and a larger number of negotiating parties.          This course addresses an area where many resource allocation decisions depend not on the outcome of market forces but on the interplay of bargaining between two or more groups. Such situations may be found in purchasing raw materials, in contracting for the services of engineers, architects, or builders, in determining the terms and conditions of a key employee's individual employment, in company take-overs, in union-management agreements concerning groups of workers, in insolvency situations, in agreeing compliance with regulatory conditions, in determining the location of an environmentally dangerous facility, and in many other areas of resource allocation.  Some of the important considerations that bear on such situations have long been understood in economics, e.g. the concept of reservation price.   Others are only now being addressed.  These new developments principally concern game theory and can be traced back to the work of Thomas Schelling as summarised in his 'The Strategy of Conflict'. It has to be emphasised that, while strategic considerations form a key part of our approach, this is not a course in game theory and we do not pursue a theoretical approach.  The approach we adopt here is more behavioural and applied.  This course attempts to recognise that the proper understanding of negotiation requires we go beyond the traditional boundaries of economics and management science, and address notions of bounded rationality, biases in decision making, social influence etc.   The course place considerable emphasis on bounded rationality and the social construction of reality.   It will also make extensive use of role-playing and group-based simulations. There will, therefore, be a substantial practical component to the teaching.  Outline Content:  1. Determining price and value; BATNA; zone of agreement; focal point; the canonical distributive bargaining case. 2. Perceptions and biases; framing; anchoring; escalation. 3. Strategic behaviour - two parties; commitment; integrative versus distributive negotiation. 4. Strategic behaviour - more than two issues; more than two parties; coalitions. 5. Bargaining over positions versus principles ('Getting to Yes'). 6. Third parties; facilitators, mediators, and arbitrators. 7. Negotiation in the Shadow of the Law. 8.

Aims, Nature, Context  The course investigates several key and inter-related features of the changing global business environment and their impact upon HRM and employment relations. First, it explores the impact of globalisation and different MNC variants (in terms of organisational structures and strategies) primarily from an institutional/business systems perspective. Second, it explores how these diverse models interact with the variety of structures and strategies of multinational companies (MNCs), drawing on both international business and international HRM literature. Of prime interest is the interaction of home and host country effects in shaping HR practices of MNCs, as well as the potential for variation across industry sectors. Third, students undertake a more in-depth, comparative analysis of 'national employment systems' - key areas of study include differences in production regimes, welfare provision, training and education systems, and the organisation of trade unions.   This course unit has the objectives of enabling students to understand and explain:  1. the implications of the growing internationalisation of business and trade both for the human resource policies of companies and for the organisation of labour and employers; 2. the characteristic features of country systems of employment and industrial relations across a range of principally developed, and to an extent, less developed countries; 3. how country differences in employment systems shape and constrain human resource policies of multinational companies; 4. the various ways multinational companies manage labour to meet complex cross-national operations in the production and delivery of goods and services; 5. the challenges to labour posed by the increasing presence of multinational companies.  On completion of the course, students should:  1. be able to discern and comment critically upon the chief institutional and cultural premises driving managerial approaches to HR/employment relations in multinational firms;  2. demonstrate ability to understand and synthesise a wide range of complex issues in the field of international HRM and comparative employment relations; 3. display in written work developing abilities to digest, synthesise and critically evaluate contrasting perspectives from the literature in reaching sustainable/practical conclusions.

Particular focus will be on the evolution of UK financial markets. The course will focus mainly on equity markets in the UK, with some focus on international equity markets, such as those in the United States and elsewhere.         Financial markets have undergone transformational changes over the past few decades; however, the last decade has witnessed the most significant changes in the way financial trading platforms operate. The changes induced by the declining costs of technology and changes in policy, hold significant implications for market structure in several respects. For example in Europe, the enactment of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in 2007 coupled with technological advances in trading systems led to the proliferation of trading venues in Europe (i.e. new electronic competitors to traditional stock exchanges or securities exchanges).  These include Broker Crossing Networks (BCNs) and Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) or Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) as they are called in Europe. The growth of alternative platforms, as with algorithmic trading and high frequency trading, has been largely driven by technology. This course therefore provides an advanced level microstructure analysis of modern financial markets as viewed through the lens of the technological transformation markets have been subjected to over the past decade.

Importantly, it will build on a theoretical approach to marketing, relationships and communications with a practical application element which develops the theory into workable practice. The course will see marketing communications as integral part of the overall offer to customers and one which represents what both the product and the brand is all about.            The first part of the course explores the links between classical marketing theory and marketing communications. It explores a variety of theoretical concepts including 1-3 step model of communications, marketing communications objectives, links between effective segmentation and communications, changing demographics and changing media environment.   The second part of the course then explores the issues surrounding the development of national and international brands. Starting with the concept of positioning, the course then moves on to explore the differences between products and brands and how correct branding development and communication strategies enable organisations to retain a clear point of difference over and above the competition.   The next part of the course looks at the key elements of message and media. For message, the course will cover a number of aspects of creative thinking. These will include convergent and divergent thinking, the importance of creativity in breaking through the noise, basic creative techniques and the development and application of marketing personas, digital mood boards and creative briefs. Ethics surrounding communications based on neuro techniques will be explored.  Media will be covered through the understanding of how media provides the mediums through which messages can be delivered.

These undesirable consequences of marketing are studied through considering their impact on consumers and society.  Student Learning Experience  The course consists of a two-hour seminar each week. Independent reading and learning is an essential component in the course and students are expected to undertake the prescribed readings so they are adequately prepared to engage in discussions. Students will also engage in various independent study tasks, in addition to the more formal assessed components of the course.

CMSE11222,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"The course aims to prepare future business leaders to recognise its multiple stakeholders, manage and consistently communicate a corporate vision and brand strategy and to know how to respond to crises if they occur. The course will help students identify the complex web of corporate stakeholder relationships; identify potential crisis issues; understand the importance of consistent communications to establish and maintain reputation and trust; devise processes to manage ongoing communications; consider tools to assist in building strong stakeholder relationships; develop tools to help influence the influencers; and devise processes to ensure the effective management of crises.          The traditional paradigms of corporate and marketing communications are being challenged in an increasingly complex global environment including 'wicked problems' and world economic crises. At the same time, businesses must adapt to increasingly knowledgeable and powerful stakeholders who expect immediate, 24/7, often personalised, communication from organisations. If concerns are identified by stakeholders, they can be shared worldwide in seconds via digital media. Whereas in previous generations, businesses could compartmentalise and manage stakeholder relationships, today¿s technology ensures the corporate brand is more a co-creation by stakeholders and the organisation, based on trust, transparency and sharing. More than ever, external and internal communications need to be strategically managed, consistent and timely to build commitment between the organisation and its stakeholders. Business leaders need to understand the dynamic environment, the inter-connectivity of stakeholders and the consequences of poor communications. A clear and consistent corporate vision and brand is needed to build trust. Business Leaders need to understand the processes and tools available to achieve affective communication. They need to recognise, anticipate and respond to potential issues/crises before they develop and create permanent damage. This course will address a significant gap in traditional management education.  Syllabus Theoretical context, stakeholders, inter-relationships and potential issues. Corporate vision, leadership and brand; Building stakeholder relationships. Strategic tools to help communicate the vision and brand.

Shifts in market, the emergence of new technologies, changes in the political and regulatory landscape, competition and globalisation compel both entrepreneurs and existing firms to foster innovation. This course examines the activities, practices and competencies involved in managing innovation in firms, whether they are start-ups or established firms, and large or small. The course explores the approach to organise and manage innovation across the range of different types of innovation, whether product, services, technologies or business models         Aims, Nature, Context   The ability of organisations to manage innovation is critical to their survival whether these organisations are small start-ups or large, established multinationals. While competitive advantage can come from size, location, or the possession of rare and inimitable resources, the pattern is increasingly favouring those organisations which can mobilize market and technological skills and experience to create novelty in their products and services, and in the ways in which they create and deliver these products and services. The aim of this course is to clarify what innovation is, and how it can be organised and managed in firms in order to create value. This course will provide students with a foundational knowledge of the key concepts and frameworks of innovation and an awareness of their practical application within organisations which is necessary for later practical and theoretical courses in the MSc programme.

Students will be able to appreciate that HRM activity does not occur in a social, legal or institutional vacuum, but is often shaped and constrained by the global and/or national economic and labour market contexts, key institutions, and the interests, and interaction, of a range of labour market actors.         Aims, Nature, Context  The course offers a critical and detailed exploration of the roles and interaction of key actors/stakeholders in systems of employment relations in developed economies (with a more in-depth analysis of the British context) i.e. unions, management, the state and various global actors - including contemporary developments affecting their current policy postures and priorities. Against this stakeholder backdrop the course aims to develop an informed understanding of the chief organisational processes that require management in any system of employment relations (including employee voice and participation mechanisms; collective bargaining and pay determination; anti-discrimination laws and the management of diversity; and the handling of dismissal, discipline and grievances).  Students will gain:   1. knowledge and understanding of the chief characteristics and institutions of employment relations' systems in developed nations;  2. the ability to critically discuss current managerial and public policy approaches towards key employment matters;  3. an understanding of the prescription and practice of how labour is organized, utilised, motivated, rewarded and disciplined.  4. insight into the practical and conceptual significance of change processes currently affecting the conduct of employment relations in the UK and overseas;  5. familiarity with the national and international contexts within which employment relations take place, including national and European regulatory frameworks, corporate governance structures and cultural issues.  6. the ability to discern and comment critically upon the chief economic and ideological premises driving government and managerial approaches to employment relations;    On completion of the course students should:  1. have secured an understanding of employment relations' processes that support organisational performance, including the design and implementation of policies and practices in a range of employment areas such as pay determination and collective bargaining, diversity management, and employee engagement, involvement and participation;  2. appreciate the importance of employment relations' procedures that help contain and resolve conflicts, and have a firm understanding of how to design and implement procedures in the areas of discipline, grievance and dismissal;  3. have the ability to locate appropriate academic and practitioner resources on employment relations topics;  4. have improved their analytical, writing and presentation skills according to accepted disciplinary conventions.

ACCN11003,Common Courses (Management School and Economics),http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_cmse.htm,"Too often numerical calculations informing decision making are seen as mere tools which deliver neutral answers. This is never the case, let alone in contemporary organisations and societies where the scale of complexity, risk and uncertainty makes clear that calculations have to be seen as an exercise to explore possible solutions rather than as a set of techniques which deliver correct answers.         The course draws on this assumption to equip participants with a critical understanding of the functioning and use of financial data and metrics in complex organizations and projects. It will do so by combining business with insights from history, science and technology studies, literature and sociology to make course participants view familiar accounting and management reports under a new light and from a different perspective. This will allow them to conceive of, and design, management control systems as platform and interfaces to devise expert governance and wise leadership.   The course aims to provide participants with an adequate understanding of how technical tools are utilised in decision making (e.g. price setting), in project management (e.g. performance evaluation and programme mobilisation) and for external reporting exercises (e.g. stakeholders' management through financial reporting).  SYLLABUS  Financial management and controls in managing large projects The roles of accounting in organizations Sources of risk and uncertainty when dealing with complex decision making processes Transparency, objectivity and independence in decision making On decision making under uncertainty (I): tools, principles and issues On decision making under uncertainty (II): mapping risks?

They will be assigned to study groups before the commencement of the module and group members are encouraged to share their impressions on the readings/case material. The module convener will also ask participants to share their knowledge on management control and risk management and link this knowledge to the cases and readings outlined in this course outline.   The role of the module leader will often be that of a facilitator of debates rather than a traditional lecturer that transmits pre-packaged knowledge. Thus, once in class, participants will be asked to bring their own experience in financial management issues. Class participation will be a key feature of the learning experience. Cases and readings will be thus utilised for developing a critical attitude towards ready-made managing solutions rather than as providing 'instructions' or definite 'guidelines' on how to deal with cost control, planning and monitoring of in complex organisations.

The course will seek to fully expose the messy, non-linear ways in which change usually takes place, and the importance of change leaders understanding the contextual imperatives that will play a defining role in the contouring of the change process.         As organizational environments become increasingly dynamic, with technological, economic, political and social, changes occurring at ever faster rates, so the transformation of organizational structures and practices has become arguably the most pervasive issue with which organizational leaders have to contend. Whether it be adopting a new technology, restructuring to improve efficiency, or expanding an operation to a new geographical locale, so being able to cope with, and lead, change efforts has become an ever more important part of the senior managerial role. Consequently, this course will develop your understanding of strategic organizational change processes.  While scholars and practicing managers have spent a great deal of time discussing how change takes place, this has frequently been overlaid with implicit, and often explicit, accounts of organizational transformations taking place in an orderly, linear fashion. These accounts are usually presented as being heavily top-down oriented with the individuals who must enact change, and are most affected by it, being largely omitted. By contrast, this course will seek to fully expose the messy, non-linear ways in which change usually takes place, and the importance of change leaders understanding the contextual imperatives that will play a defining role in the contouring of the change process. These include internal issues of power, culture, interests and communication, and external imperatives including political, economic, and social dimensions. With these points in mind, the intent is to cover a broad gamut of issues that are associated with change in order to provide participants with a comprehensive appreciation of what to expect when encountering, or leading, organizational transformation.  Syllabus Approaches to change management Understanding why organizations change Types of change - from incremental to radical transformation Diagnosing change Resistance to change Change implementation The visioning process Communicating change Sustaining change.  Student Experience The intent of this course is to blend cutting-edge strategic change theories with practical examples, drawn from selected cases, guest speakers and participants own personal experiences. The approach is highly interactive ¿ one of the most important, and compelling, aspects of EMBA classes is the communal development and application of understanding benefiting from the varied experiences of class members. Given that everybody in the class will have experienced, or will be currently contending with, major strategic change initiatives, the course has been structured to allow class members to apply the principles that they learn to their own change cases.

First, develop themselves as a scholar and as a person; second, create a portfolio of research papers, some of which should be published prior to graduation; third, plan, carry out, and write up a major research project that will constitute the doctoral thesis. On graduation students will be expected to have produced a thesis that advances our theoretical understanding of a business-related topic. This means that they should be at the cutting edge of knowledge in that area, something that will be formally assessed. In so doing, they will develop the tools that will prepare them for a successful academic career.  This course is designed to point new doctoral researchers in the right direction with regards to the objectives outlined above. It is intended that PhD students will take this course during their first year.         This programme of topics is intended to iteratively build towards the provision of a holistic understanding of some of the key things that are required to be successful in the doctoral programme. It should also provide a solid foundation of good practices to stand students in good stead throughout their careers.  Topics covered will include: -What to Expect and what to strive towards -How to build a successful student-supervisor relationship -Contribution, Contribution, Contribution -UK data and other research mistakes -Sexy titles and other writing mistakes -Pathways to impact -Academic conferences -What makes a piece of research interesting -PhD Reflections -Reviewing for academic journals  The course has a programme of two-hour weekly seminars for 11 weeks. There is a required text which is provided to all students and a poster presentation session which is assessed and attendance is compulsory.  This course will be primarily organised around interactive discussions that will often involve guest speakers. In this way, students will get opportunities to interact with some of the leading research faculty in the Business School, all of who have extensive experience of working with doctoral students. Students will also hear from a recently completed doctoral student discussing various aspects about how they carried out their PhD, what they did when things went wrong, how they went about presenting at conferences, publishing their first paper, and so on.

The course will also consider the international marketing mix and the challenges this may pose.   This course builds on students' knowledge gained in the core courses, therefore complementing the other courses and minimising overlap of materials.         In recent years, it has become difficult for organisations to restrict their services to domestic markets only. While the firm may confine its activities to the local market, the market itself is unlikely to be so restricted and may be served by firms headquartered in or operating from a number of other foreign countries or regions. Therefore, knowledge of international issues is of vital importance to all organisations whether they are actively involved in foreign markets or have foreign competitors at home. The increased risk and complexity the international marketers face are because of the increased uncertainty from operating in diverse and less understood environments.

The course will focus principally on the role of governments and public sector actors in providing, catalysing and mobilising financial flows for climate change mitigation and adaptation in both developing and developed countries. It explores the connections between the political ""100 billion"" climate finance commitment at the international level and the ""100 trillion"" investment challenge governments face to meet the investment needs to transform national economies. It will look at the different tools, instruments, and policies that these mandates entail - as well as  the interactions between governments and the private sector as public resources are used to 'leverage', 'redirect' and 'blend' additional private finance and investment. It will go beyond mitigation objectives to present an overview of the challenges related to adaptation, research & development financing, supporting SMEs and the creation of entire climate service value chains. Finally, the course will also provide an introduction to the concepts of 'concessionality' and the measuring and evaluation frameworks used by public institutions to determine how public funds are used for climate finance         The course aims to provide students with an understanding of principal concepts upon which decisions around international climate finance are made. It will compare and contrast the different conceptual framings that influence how governments use public resource to achieve often complementary, but at times divergent, goals on climate change. The course aims to provide students with the fundamental concepts to analyse and understand the choices on climate finance and investment made by governments and their implementing institutions and agencies. The course will explore the connection between public policy, public financial institutions, and the private sector, seeking to understand how public resources are used to ""redirect"", ""leverage"", ""mobilise"" and ""blend"" private finance and investment.   The course develops the key concepts, critical understanding and hard skills to assess and understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types of public intervention. Students will develop their ability to assess how governments and public financial institutions determine the appropriate use of public funds through an assessment of different approaches to concessionality and concessional finance. It will also explore some of the principal components of measuring and evaluation frameworks used by these institutions to determine how public funds are used for climate finance.  The course will build on the fundamental concepts and critical understanding developed in the first half of Semester 1 in the Climate Change Policy and Investment course. It will run in parallel to Carbon Markets course as well as Advanced Energy Finance - providing complementary insights on how public actors frame and act on investment and finance topics.

It is therefore important to begin to understand the intricacies and complexities of managing people in the modern workplace. The course will consider the extent to which the terms of the debate on managing employees have shifted in recent years, largely driven by key changes in the economic, political, social and legal environment. In particular, the course will focus on developments in the key component parts of human resource management, such as strategic HRM, the labour market, recruitment and selection and training and development.         Eight core HRM topics are covered in the course. They range from broader themes, for example the impact of HRM practices in general on employees and their experience of work and organisations, to more specific components of the employment relationship, such as selection procedures and the management of workplace conflict. The course will comprise a mixture of formal lectures, group discussions and exercises. Guest speakers from academia and industry will also be invited to contribute to some of the lectures. The lecture programme will provide an overview of key debates in this area, supported by the recommended readings. The aim of the lectures is to identify key concerns, to be further evaluated in subsequent discussion sessions. The course will examine major themes in human resource management and draw heavily on practice, using various sources of evidence, including that from the lecturers¿ own research and employment experience. The group discussions in class provide an opportunity for students to clarify their understanding of the issues raised and to critically reflect on important questions. In all aspects, students are encouraged to apply academic concepts and frameworks to real workplace problems. This overall approach is appropriate to the learning objectives of the course.  -To examine the roles and functions of HRM professionals. -To explore the range of techniques and practices used by HRM professionals in all major aspects of managing employees. -To explore the level of adoption of such techniques and practices, and to offer explanations for patterns of adoption. -To consider whether it is possible to identify ¿best practice¿ in human resource management. -To examine the effects of specific practices in terms of managerial and employee experience in the workplace. -To critique and challenge some of the underlying assumptions of the literature and suggest new alternatives.

At the end of the course, participants are expected to: Understand the use in practice and limitations of basic financial techniques to assess the viability of major investment decisions; Link various degrees of risk to different financing options and understand how financial metrics may distort our perception of risk and feasibility; Design data visualizations to monitor performance, stimulate collaboration and mediation of conflicting interests, question taken-for-granted assumptions when making decisions; Utilise performance measurement and control techniques to mobilise change, increase chances of success and avoid failure; Be aware of the organisational, political and social role that accounting figures can play in practical settings where stakeholders have varied and conflicting interests.  Outline Content The first Sessions (1 to 4) are dedicated to introduce the overall themes of the course, its structure, the role of the participants in class and, above all, the approach followed in treating issues of management control under situations of risk and uncertainty, especially in relation to large organizations and megaprojects. We will move beyond a conventional view of management control as a mere technical matter based on objective accounting calculations to introduce various roles that these play in organizations and programme management. While the first 4 sessions serve to identify various roles that management control practices play in organizations that operate under conditions of risk and uncertainty.

Specifically, we will look at risks entailed by cash flow discounting techniques in assessing viability of such investments and the factors to take into account when evaluating large infrastructure investments. We will also discuss how financial numbers can be used in managing stakeholders and media when communicating (intermediate and final) financial results. The remining sessions (7 to 10)of the course will explore how to build effective management control systems in situations of ambiguity and uncertainty, introducing issues related to assessing performance and risk, and controlling the ongoing development of the venture.

It will engage you through an evidence-based approach of international business, drawing on the latest research and case studies. It will help you analyse the complexities of international business by linking the ""business"" element with an institutional view, reflecting current economic, cultural and political changes that affect multinational enterprises. At the end of the course, you will work with a practitioner on a real business case of international strategy, and mobilise your acquired knowledge and craft in a real-world situation.         Academic Description   International business is fraught with great risks and presents the scope for major mistakes, which firms make time after time.   On this course you will learn and understand those risks, learn how they are best overcome, and advise a real firm from an emerging market how it can expand internationally. The first part of the course will be devoted to acquire the methods of analysing an international business case, and the conceptual knowledge that underpins them. The course will give you a unified framework of analysis by introducing two complementary core perspectives: (1) an institution-based view and (2) a resource-based view. This framework presents an extension of existing research that investigates IB topics. Throughout the semester, the course will engage you through an evidence-based approach, based on a core textbook and the latest research as published in the Journal of International Business Studies and other leading IB and general management journals. Furthermore, you will work on numerous up-to-date examples, case studies and exercises that cover different geographic areas. This continuous work will not only encourage you to build bridges between theoretical frameworks and the contemporary world of business, but also encourage you to find further examples in newspapers and magazines, such as Financial Times and The Economists.    At the end of the semester, you will work closely with a business in an emerging market. Equipped with the knowledge and experience acquired during the first part of the course, you will help them define their project, analyse the risks and opportunities attached to it, and deliver recommendations as how to achieve it. This exercise is voluntarily time-constrained, over a couple of weeks only, to put you in the conditions of real consultants who work under pressure and need to meet tight deadlines to satisfy their clients.    By the end of the course, you will be aware of important concepts and theoretical frameworks that are relevant for managers and firms seeking to develop an international business.    Outline Content   The course will cover a new topic every week. The course will be structured into three chapters:   1- Foundations and presentation of the main frameworks   2- Doing business across borders from international trade to globalisation   3- Implementing internationalisation strategies    Student Learning Experience   The course adopts a flipped classroom method, which means that the students are expected to read the material before each lecture. Lectures will be devoted to mastering the material, and seminars to the discussions of the main concepts, frameworks, exercises and application to real-world cases. The lectures will encourage you to actively use the material in small exercises, reflection questions and brainstorming. Seminars will develop along with the discussions taking place in the classroom. Notes will be taken ""live"" during the discussions, and inputs will emerge from the discussions themselves. Therefore, students will take an active role in the building of the seminars, not only through their preparation of each session, but also through their active participation to classroom interactions. The capacity to combine the two complementary perspectives to analyse a case will be evidenced through the first, individual assignment. The capacity to advise a business based on broader knowledge of international business will be demonstrated through the second assignment        ",Global Strategies and Emerging Markets,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cxcmse11477.htm

The course examines creative industries as cultural production systems by drawing on a variety of disciplines (economics, sociology, strategic management) and by utilising specific cases to understand their historical, cultural, structural and competitive dynamics.         What do Spotify and the British Museum have in common? What processes did lead to the creation of molecular gastronomy and to the success of Cirque Du Soleil? Who can claim rights over a Banksy's work, given the anonymity of the artist? Exploring answers to these and other questions, the course aims to introduce students to the basic dimensions that constitute a creative industry. The course is organised around key roles and concepts in cultural production systems. Creative industries may be purpose-driven, expressing ideas, identities, aesthetics and culture; they may be profit-driven, seeking commercial success and competitive advantage. Most of the time, they pursue both aims, in various combinations. Creative industries include large global corporations, public entities, entrepreneurial firms and individual creators. They may serve local markets, export their services or products, or link producers and consumers. They involve different actors and possess distinctive properties. We will draw on three sources of knowledge:  1) theoretical frameworks and research findings from sociology, economics, and strategy 2) cases and media accounts of specific organisations 3) students' group analysis of selected organisations.  We will discuss how value is created, organised, defined and protected; who are the actors involved in different creative industries; how creativity, innovation and change are made possible and sustainable; how knowledge from creative industries can be transferred to other business settings.  The course is client-based: in teams, you will work on a real problem faced by an important cultural organisation based in Edinburgh, and develop strategic recommendations to address their issues. The consulting challenge will require intense group work, high-quality output, and frequent engagement with the client and the lecturer.

Academic Description Traditional research in business analytics focused on the decision theoretic perspectives, in which a single decision-making authority optimises the system as a whole under exogenous uncertainty. The past decades saw the evolution of business studies to address management problems with strategic uncertainty, in which different individuals, divisions and/or firms strategically interact with each other. Strategic interactions in multi-agent problems create new challenges for managers. As a natural quantitative analytical tool for such multi-agent decision making problems, game theory has widely and successfully been applied to the field of business management. This course introduces game theory as analytical tools and provides insights into managerial situations in order to assist with decision making when multiple agents with conflicting objectives are involved. To be more specific, it provide students with both cooperative and non-cooperative game theory based quantitative frameworks to analyse strategic interactions in economic problems and its impact on managerial decision making and to understand strategic situations in which different individuals/divisions/firms may have potentially conflicting incentives.

This course aims to develop students' understanding of the basic principles of financial markets and provides a very good foundation on how assets are valued and traded. The course considers stock market prices and returns; stock market risk and the influence of risk on the pricing of shares;  interest rates and the pricing of bonds; and the characteristics and pricing of financial futures and options. It also considers Corporate Finance and Financial Theories.  But the most important contribution of this course to your future career is how to use the academic insights to better assess risks and returns, and the trade-off between the two in your future decision making.   Scientific insights develop and change over time. Traditional views on financial markets are changing rapidly and many of the standard paradigms and theory are nowadays questioned. On the one hand because of recent developments like the recent financial crisis, on the other hand because of new theoretical and empirical developments in the academic literature. This course aims to consider issues from both theoretical perspective as well as practical perspective. It will address both the standard theory but also offer some of the new and alternative views. It is important to be aware of the most well used theoretical models from a practical point of view but it is also important for students who want to follow an academic career.   The topics covered in this course can be broadly categorised into three groups:   *Financial Theories. This includes portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory, all of which have become an integrated part of the decision-making in investments. It will also discuss patterns in cross-sections of stick returns, the time-series behaviour of stick returns time-varying expected returns. *Introduction to Fixed-Income and Derivative Instruments. This includes bonds, options and futures. *Corporate Finance: This includes capital budgeting, cost of capital, capital structure.  Student learning experience:  Students should devote 40 hours on understanding pre-recorded lectures and assigned readings (at least 4 hours per week). Students should engage with weekly materials (videos and assigned readings) before the scheduled seminar in the following week. Weekly seminars will explore and reinforce key themes from the weekly materials through a combination of discussion points, exercises, and Q&As. Course discussion board also allows students to ask questions outside of contact time.

There will be a focus on the the use of derivatives as risk-management and securities structuring instruments.         This course is built around four key areas which relate to how the principles of finance and derivatives, in particular, can be used to address problems in finance. As a topic, financial engineering is strongly practical while at the same time drawing on key insights from finance and the pricing of derivatives. it makes use of  a wide variety of insights from the theory and practice of financial management and integrates these into how they are applied in practice through the way ""structured securities"" are created as well as other examples of financial engineering (e.g. risk management). Over the course, students will be exposed to a variety of applications of the key tools of finance, both in terms of how to model cash flows and making use of the derivative product set (that is, forward contracts, futures, swaps and options).  The course will provide examples of how the tools, knowledge and understanding of the derivative product set can be applied to particular representative problems in securities structuring, risk management and cash flow sculpting. A key part of the subject is to demonstrate the practical application of both the theory and practice of finance within a range of contexts. Consequently, the emphasis in the course is on practical financial management and pricing transactions rather than the mathematics of derivatives. To integrate the discussion, the course stresses the relationship that exists between derivatives and fundamental financial instruments (cash securities) and, in particular, the important no-arbitrage conditions that underlie the pricing of derivatives. Note that the course does not delve into the more advanced aspects of derivatives valuation such as stochastic processes, although an intuitive understanding of this is required.  After introducing the key elements of financial engineering early on, the course will explore initially how to use terminal instruments (forwards, futures and swaps) before expanding to examine the important role played by options as risk management tools. Key aspects of options, their modelling and risk management are covered within the focus on practical application of these instruments either on their own or as part of a portfolio.  Student Learning Experience Student learning on this course will primarily be through reading, thinking, class discussions, attending lectures and tutorials, solving exercises, and attempting problems.

The aim, therefore, is that students emerge from the course with a solid academic and practical understanding of how start-up entrepreneurs go about creating, delivering and capturing value for their customers.   Key practical tasks are to work in a group to come up with a business idea, develop a pitch for this idea and write up a feasibility study of the idea. These activities are supported by sessions - including guest sessions from entrepreneurs - that will provide skills and knowledge about start-up planning frameworks and tools (e.g. formal planning, lean start-up, effectuation).

It is intended to provide students with a deep understanding of issues associated with the financing of entrepreneurial activities, and the financial assessment of the performance of new ventures. First, we will analyse principles of corporate finance, valuation, and negotiation, with an eye toward developing the tools and concepts of entrepreneurial financial management.  Second, we will use examples on firms at different stages of development to illustrate how these tools and concepts may be applied in practice         Aims, Nature, Context   The capital market for financing such entrepreneurs and private equity investing more generally differs fundamentally from capital markets considered in standard corporate finance: First, start-ups are young, mostly unprofitable companies, with short operating histories and little capital.  Young firms face exceptionally high degrees of uncertainty, constraining financing and creating difficult decisions about financial contracting, keeping in mind that today's financial decisions may have implications for future opportunities and choices.  Second, available capital markets for privately held companies are predominantly deal markets where terms and valuations are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, where investors can add value or are actively involved with the companies they finance.     Throughout the course, we emphasis financial opportunities and decisions of entrepreneurs and private equity investors investing in these entrepreneurs. The programme is broadly structured into five parts. The first modules covered the basic ideas, tools and techniques which, once mastered, will greatly facilitate work throughout the remaining modules and group project. We then go on to consider financial forecasting and assessment of ongoing operation, distinct sources of finance, valuation of entrepreneurial companies and finally possible exit routes.

UNCTAD data indicates that the share of EMNCs in the world's outward foreign direct investment has witnessed dramatic increase in recent years, from 0.35% in 1970, to 5.05% in 2000, and over 35% in recent years. Extant research generally points to the fact that EMNCs behave differently from those from advanced markets such as US and Germany; as such, studying HRM in EMNCs provides a unique opportunity for us to reflect on exiting theories in the area of international human resource management and international management in general, which are largely based on analysis of advanced market MNCs. This course is designed to provide students with alternative perspectives and empirical evidence to understand this relatively new but important phenomenon in today's business world.

An institutional perspective will be adopted to analyse how the home country (i.e. where they come from) and host country (e.g. where they operate) institutions lead to some unique challenges faced by this particular type of MNCs.   A wide range of topics are covered, including how emerging market MNCs are different from advanced market MNCs (e.g. firms from US and UK) in their approach to managing people, how they construct organisational identities to gain and maintain legitimacy in the West, and how they deal with the dilemma of centralisation and localisation issue.

The convergence of mobile connectivity, social media, enterprise social, the Cloud, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, automation and the blockchain, combined with the rapid emergence of a new generation of constantly connected customers and constantly connected employees (Gen C), is threatening to reshape industry and the public sector faster than at any time in history.   With reports suggesting that four out of ten industry incumbents, across a broad spectrum of sectors, could be displaced by digital disruption over the next five years, many organisations are on the verge of becoming digital dinosaurs due to their inability to adapt. No industry, no organisation is immune from the threat of being disrupted. With 40 per cent of jobs being replaced by digital technology over the next two decades, no individual is immune.  Digital enabled transformation has become the number one challenge facing organisations today. Nothing else comes close.  Leaders for the Digital Age Urgently Required  As we move from the WHY to the HOW of transformation, a new breed of senior executive is urgently required - Leaders for the Digital Age; senior executives who combine high level business knowledge, experience and understanding with the ability to implement transformation strategies fully aligned with and supportive of agreed business goals and objectives. Leaders who possess the confidence and personal skills to drive digital enabled organisational change.  This five-day Executive Masterclass provides participants with highly practical tools and frameworks for leading in an era of turbulent digital change and disruption, leaders for an inter-connected world.           The course will be structured around key topics critical to successful digital transformation:  Understanding the Digital Landscape - the disruptive technologies and associated societal changes reshaping industry; emerging opportunities and threats.  External Digital - the new rules of sales, marketing, PR and service in an era of customer empowerment.  Internal Digital: the use of digital internally to build a Digital Operating Advantage, rethinking the way organisations work, breaking free from the limits imposed by legacy technology and legacy management thinking.  Strategy Development for the Digital Era : the key steps involved in developing a transformation vision and strategy fit-for-purpose in a digital age; digital performance measurement.  Implementation and Digital Leadership: overcoming barriers to change; implementing successful transformation; the importance of people and culture not just technology; the role and personal traits of an effective digital leader.

Students should acquire a background of knowledge on the processes by which firms in emerging markets enhance their technological and innovation capacity; this knowledge should be sufficient to allow them to intelligently follow, and take part in, discussions on these issues, and to think creatively about how to apply the knowledge gained in real-life practice.            The course will focus primarily on the relationships between Multi-National Corporations and domestic firms in emerging markets. In it, we will look at the strategies of both types of firms and how those strategies shape both collaboration and competition. We will examine technology transfer and the development of innovation capacity, to see how domestic players in emerging markets learn from their relationships with MNCs, gradually enhancing their ability to become independent players in the Global Knowledge-Based Economy. We will analyse the dynamics of these relationships, which can involve both co-operation (during which the emerging market firms learn first how to imitate) and competition (as they learn how to innovate and begin to do more of the things that the MNC partners have reserved for themselves in the past). We will consider successful examples of knowledge-based economy development from the Pacific Rim and then look at the lessons for China, India and the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe.

The first is to give students the opportunity to discuss and debate some key issues in understanding international business and emerging markets (including analyses of highly relevant case studies). The second is to give them an opportunity to develop their debating skills and, by exposing them to a variety of viewpoints, help them develop a higher level of appreciation for the complexity of the issues than could be gained from merely reading textbooks and articles.  The course will complement the other two first semester core courses: Global Strategies and Emerging Markets and Developing Knowledge-based International Businesses in Emerging Economies, and prepare students for second semester courses such as 'Doing International Business Projects with Emerging Markets'.          This course gives students the opportunity to discuss and debate some current issues in international business and emerging markets (including internationalization of firms, emerging market multinationals, platform economy, future of work, exit strategies, emerging market finance and financial markets, corporate social responsibility, corruption etc.) and, by exposing them to a variety of viewpoints, help them develop a higher level of appreciation for the complexity of the issues than could be gained from merely reading textbooks and attending lectures. To achieve this purpose, the sessions serve as the bases for developing debating skills throughout the first half of the course. The second purpose is to give the student an opportunity to employ their debating skills on group and individual assignments on which they will be assessed in the second half.   The assessment includes a group project (group video presentation) and an individual case study analysis in which the students would apply the debating skills on current issues in international business and emerging markets they have learned throughout the course and the semester. In each session, an expert in that field will be invited in order to facilitate the most vibrant, yet fun, environment for students to grasp up-to-date knowledge and enjoy the relevant debates.

It will do so by combining business with insights from history, science and technology studies, literature and sociology to make course participants view familiar accounting and management reports under a new light and from a different perspective. This will allow them to conceive of, and design, management control systems as platforms and interfaces to facilitate internal and external communication, devise expert governance and exercise wise leadership.  The course aims to provide participants with an adequate understanding of how technical tools are utilised in decision making (e.g. price setting), in project management (e.g. performance evaluation and programme mobilisation) and for reporting exercises (e.g. stakeholders¿ management).  Students will be required to do a substantial amount of reading and to share their impressions on the readings/case material via the online discussion forums. The course lecturer will also ask participants to share their knowledge on management control and risk management and link this knowledge to the cases and readings outlined in this course outline.  The role of the course lecturer will often be that of a facilitator of debates rather than a traditional lecturer who transmits pre-packaged knowledge. Thus participants will be asked to bring their own experience in financial management issues to the online discussion forums and participation in these will be a key feature of the learning experience. Cases and readings will be thus utilised for developing a critical attitude towards ready-made management solutions rather than as providing instructions, or definite guidelines, on how to deal with cost control, planning and monitoring of in complex organizations.

Across both public and private sector financial actors, two principal areas of focus are the management of risks associated with climate change and the alignment of assets and portfolios with climate goals agreed by governments. The course will provide an overview of the concepts and initiatives related to these management approaches (e.g. the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures), and the skills and techniques necessary to implement these practices.         Academic Description  The course provide students with an understanding of principal concepts emerging within the financial sector to taken climate change into account in decision-making and portfolio management. Across both public and private sector financial actors, two principal areas of focus are the management of risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the alignment of assets and portfolios with climate goals agreed by governments. The application and implementation of these management strategies, in turn, is highly dependent different types of forward-looking assessments such as scenarios, forecasting and modelling.  The course develops practical knowledge for implementing these practices. Students will develop the critical thinking skills to evaluate whether emerging practices are fit for purpose for use by different financial actors (banking, asset management, institutional investors) as well as for different mandates (impact-driven versus maximising financial returns).  The course builds on the Carbon Accounting course, using concepts introduced in the first semester to assess the exposure to climate-related risks and/or the consistency with national and international climate goals. The course complements and applies in part the concepts from the Climate Policy & Investment and Carbon Pricing course as carbon pricing is one of the principal policies and drivers behind different forms of climate-related risks. It also builds upon the International Climate Finance course as it explores how mandated financial institutions, ie those seeking to have a positive contribution to achieving climate-related goals, integrate this into their decision making strategies. It provides a complementary perspective to the Baseline-and-Credit course by introducing alternative methods of integrating climate change in to decision making. Finally, it is complementary to the Sustainable Finance course is complementary to the Sustainable Finance course, bringing a forward-looking perspective to the broader discussion of portfolio allocation.

In so doing, students will be encouraged to explore a range of practical techniques that can be used in dealing with change. The course requires critical reflection on theory and practice from an ethical and professional standpoint and provides opportunities for applied learning and continuous professional development.         Aims, Nature, Context Organisations, their workforces, clients and customers face new internal and external contextual issues on a regular basis. This module covers organisational design and development. The course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of organisational change via the theories and conceptual frameworks of organisation design and the principles and practices of organisational development. Both are critical to our understanding of organisations and how they function and both reside within a framework of organisation theory. The course focuses on decisions that have to be made on the most appropriate organisational structure(s) to ensure dynamic delivery of organisational activities.   Organisation design is about shaping an organisation to maximise its effectiveness; aiming for flexibility in delivery of its services. Through breaking down departmental barriers, seeking improved supply efficiencies, teamwork and collaboration and working towards better customer management and retention, organisations can enhance their performance and ensure that organisational goals and targets are achieved. Organisation design activities therefore focus on finding the most appropriate structures, relationships between departments and sections, and allocation of work activities, including definition of duties and role responsibilities. The module also focuses on how an organisation's culture, values and environment support and enhance organisational performance and adaptability.   Organisation development is defined by CIPD as a 'planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people'. This might include how organisational members acquire new skills, knowledge and behaviours, and do things differently, often as part of the application of continuous improvement strategies. The concept of the 'learning organisation' as one of a number of organisation development strategies that might be adopted as part organisational change activities is also explored.

Students are matched in groups to assess and address real-world, climate change-related challenges that a private or public-sector organisation is experiencing. During the course students investigate and try to solve this challenge in the form of a consulting project. By the end of the course students present their findings and solutions through a written consulting report to their clients, examiners and other stakeholders.         Climate change brings significant risks for natural and social systems. These developments pose fundamental challenges to the way in which society is organised and governed. An increasing number of studies therefore advise that an interdisciplinary effort from businesses, society and policy makers alike is needed to respond to these challenges. The Carbon and Environmental Consulting Project is an interdisciplinary MSc course at the University of Edinburgh Business School, and challenges students to think about climate change in the context of organisations' current and future decision-making. Currently, businesses are largely seen as organisations that are impacted by climate change, rather than being important participants, and possibly leaders, in attaining a low carbon society. Students will learn to challenge this interpretation of organisations by gaining an in-depth understanding of the fundamental challenges that climate change and environmental-related issues pose to business current decision making. More specifically, students will gain expertise on how business leaders make decisions related to climate change and environmental-related issues and how specific problems can be solved through knowledge attained in previous classes. The course will prepare students to be future leaders that engage with climate change in sustainable, profitable and meaningful ways.   Students are matched in groups to assess and address a real-world, climate change-related challenges that a private or public-sector organisation is experiencing. During the course students investigate and try to solve this challenge in the form of a consulting project.

The main focus of the course is on the successful cooperation between the student groups and their client partner. Students are therefore expected to spend a significant amount of time consulting with the client partner and their group members outside of the lectures/discussion sessions. Students are expected to deliver their final work in the form of a written report. There will also be other written assignments.   A Carbon and Environment Consulting challenge involves: 1.A private or public sector organisation/business (the 'client') who proposes a challenge. 2.A group MSc students who address the proposed challenge over a 10/11-week period. Towards the end of this period the group of students provides a written consultancy report and video to the client which detail the findings and associated solutions. 3.An appropriate level of input from the client during the 10/11-week period through e.g. access to data, periodic guidance and conversations via emails, phone and face-to-face meetings. The client also attends (physically or virtually) the initial briefing meeting at the beginning and the final video at the end of the 10/11-week period.  The client receives a detailed written report and video addressing the proposed challenge, and may also benefit by building links with potential graduate employees. Students gain considerable benefit from working on a real-world project, including learning how to communicate and work with a client.

It requires no background knowledge and is specifically tailored to the novice's needs. Anyone with an interest in technology will greatly benefit from following this course.          This course aims to introduce students from the MSc in Finance, Technology and Policy into the strategic potential and limitations of Blockchain technology to shape contemporary business models, markets and institutions. Despite the widespread interest and hype, Blockchain is still a nascent technology and a clear strategy for its successful implementation has not yet materialised. Without a critical understanding of the potential value Blockchain can generate and the feasibility of applying it, organisations will not generate benefits from its potential. Against this background, this course explores the following questions: how can organisations develop a strategic business case that justifies major investments in Blockchain technology? What are the risks that have to be taken into account in this process? What are potential future developments in the industry and in relation to policy-making?  The course explores these concerns with a focus on the potential strategic importance of Blockchain for specific sectors within the economy and society, and it draws from specific use-cases to assess what approaches are likely to generate value. The course will also offer broader reflections on the role of tech innovations in reshaping contemporary institutions and values within an increasingly digitised society. While participants will develop a strong understanding of the underlying concepts and driving forces of these questions, the course does not strictly focus on a granular and tech-focused exploration of Blockchain. Instead it develops the necessary skills of students to become competent decision-makers and analysts to guide strategy and policy.  Outline Content The course is built out of the following topics:  -An introduction to Blockchain technology, its evolution and its key building blocks and concepts. -Blockchain as a disruptor of existing business models, institutions and values  -Limitations and frontiers of Blockchain -Critically developing a strategic business case for Blockchain -The policy environment for the technological innovations like Blockchain  Student Learning Experience The course will consist of 5 in class lectures that provide the theoretical background and analytical skills for the course. Furthermore, the course will also foster independent learning through a prolonged research-based group project in the second half of the course. Here, students will develop a strategic business case for Blockchain by selecting and researching a particular industry or societal problem. In so doing, students will further develop a critical understanding of the potential, the risks and the limitations of Blockchain in complementing or transforming existing business models in that particular industry. The students will present the findings from the research project to the rest of the class at the end of the semester, which exposes all students to the results and different learning experiences gained throughout the course.

The rise of the information age has brought a profound structural shift in the way value is generated by modern organizations and accounted for in economies and societies. In 1975, tangible assets accounted for more than 80 percent of the market value of the 500 largest US firms. By 2015 the situation was entirely inverted, with nearly 90 percent of market capitalization deriving from intangible assets. Accordingly, accounting for value is no longer solely driven by fixed physical and financial assets, but instead by more fluid resources, such as relationships, networks, intellectual, social and human capital. This transformational trend has called into question the relevance of many traditional accounting and reporting tools. Addressing these challenges entails the need to introduce accounting models that embrace and tackle these issues to account for a richer and more dynamic concept of value. This module introduces and critical evaluates such accounting tools for decision-making.

The topics covered will include, accounting's roles in slavery and war (to encourage a deeper evaluation of the ethical implications of accounting); insolvency practice; accountability and transparency; privatisation; football and the financial crisis. The course will reflect upon the power of accounting and its impact on our everyday lives.         Academic Description Accounting as an academic discipline is rather different from most other academic subjects because of its complex relationship with a powerfully coherent and socially influential profession with its own discourse. This class aims to provide students with different contemporary theories with which to interrogate accounting from a wider social, economic and political context. The theories dealt with in the class are in various ways concerned with discourse and/or semiotics and so can be seen as important tools for analysing the discourse of accounting in various contexts, as well as its performativity. Specifically the course will critically evaluate accounting's claims to provide neutral information to business, government and society in general.  Outline Content This course is concerned with the use of various social theories in the interrogation of accounting practice. The course begins with a general introduction to social theories in accounting in order to situate the different theoretical perspectives in relationship to each other. It then, through considering how they are used in academic research, enable the insights they may or may not offer to accounting practice, practitioners and students. The course will cover an array of arenas including insolvency practice, football, slavery and war, accounting profession diversity, the financial crisis, accountability and transparency and privatisation.  Student Learning Experience This course will be structured around a mixture of formal lecture and discussion topics. Each new topic will be covered in the lecture; students will then be expected to undertake the readings for the week, and prepare a group presentation on the topic. Thus topic 1 will straddle weeks 1 and 2, topic 2 will straddle weeks 2 and 3, and so on. This course is very demanding in the sense that the readings are challenging. This course is structured in an evolutionary manner so that an understanding of earlier topics is required for latter ones. While the course aims to provide a deeper understanding of accounting, it is intended, also to enable students to hone their deeper-order learning skills.

Its objective is to provide the accounting and financial background desirable for any intending business manager, and an introduction to those analytical tools necessary to understand the financial management of an organisation and the interrelationship between the organisation's accounting results, financing and decision-making. Specifically we focus on the following topics: the accounting process, basic financial statements and their interpretation, capital investment decisions, and basic managerial decision-making techniques. The introductory nature of the course implies that it is very appropriate for students with no or minimum level of accounting knowledge and computation skills. Students with knowledge of accounting and/or financial management at intermediate levels or higher will not find the course suitable for their needs.         Accounting is described as the ""process of identifying, measuring and communicating economic information to permit informed judgements and decisions by users of the information"" (American Accounting Association). As described, accounting is involved with the generation of both financial and non-financial information that will be utilised by decision-makers to make good.  Similarly, financial management is mainly about making decision relating to assets, liabilities, cash management, investing and financing activities. Together, accounting and financial management are related to the decisions that organisations make with the resources they have as well as communicating the information to interested parties.  This course aims to provide students with an understanding of the basic areas of accounting and financial management to enable them to function as members of the management decision-making team in their organisation.  The particular emphasis is on the application of techniques and interpretation of financial information.  Student Learning Experience: The initial topics in the course provide opportunities to apply individual understanding and knowledge in weekly end-of-lecture exercises to an analysis of financial statements in a group setting. Learning will take place throughout the course via a combination of formal lectures, in-class exercises, discussion and assessments (group work and a final examination).

The students will gain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental challenges that climate change poses to the way in which the economy and society are organised.         Climate change brings significant risks for natural and social systems costing at least 5% and up to 20% of global GDP each year. These developments pose fundamental challenges to the way in which society is organised and governed and will multiply existing threats at a very rapid pace.

Their overall goal will be to learn - through theories, examples and practice - the stakes involved in becoming competent persuaders.           We will study theories and techniques of persuasion in order to develop our own persuasive capacities. This means that we will study persuasion as a craft learned through exemplars and by means of practice. For our theories, we look towards philosophical accounts of rhetoric. For our techniques, we looks towards psychological models. For our practice, we produce copy.     We begin with a consideration of rhetorical situations: what they are and how we should negotiate them. This first half of the course brings us into contact with old ideas that remain applicable, as we shall see, to contemporary situations. We pay special attention here to the enduring critique of rhetoric, as developed by Plato, as well as to the alternative representation of rhetoric as a craft that we have inherited from Aristotle. With these foundations set by means of old theories and recent examples, we then proceed, in the second half of the course, towards a consideration of the challenges that define the application of psychological insights to the craft of persuasion.

Academic Description: Over the past decade or so, there has been a resurgence of public discourse and policy debate on the 'future of work'. This conversation tends to revolve around the subject of technology. Indeed, technology is gaining increasing significance in the study and teaching of business and management. While much of this work has focused on how technology shapes and fulfils organisational, business and market imperatives, there is increasing interest in examining how workers/employees, and society at large, experience and respond to technological changes. This latter intervention aims to conceptualise the future of work more broadly by interrogating how technology has impacted the meaning of work ¿ i.e. what counts as work/what we do for work ¿ and employment relations on a global scale.      Accordingly, this course aims to unpack the future of work beyond its technology-driven reconfigurations by engaging with the social and ethical transformations unfolding in the world of work. This is of particular importance to prevent the perpetuation of cultural blind-spots in the eager push for technological advancement. In particular, the proposed course will demonstrate how technology changes the experience and possibilities for work, and hence of life chances, along lines of social and global inequalities of race, gender, ability and class. It will thus help demonstrate the differential social and global impacts of technology in work.    Overall, the course will provide tools for intelligent and meaningful engagement with technology in the context of work as well as for the critical evaluation of yourselves as social agents in the wider world.

Student Learning Experience:  Pedagogy: This course will be delivered mainly through interactive lectures wherein active participation (listening and questioning) is highly encouraged. The approach to teaching undertaken in this course will not entail the mere delivery of information. Rather it follows from an of understanding of knowledge as co-created based on a critically-informed intersection of facts, experience, method.   This course will model the following pedagogic view:  - Knowledge is still contextual and relative, uncertain and tentative, yet it is possible to take positions, make choices, commit oneself.  - The instructor is someone who is fully aware of uncertainty yet has the courage to make commitments.  - Teaching is challenging and encouraging students to explore complexities fully and then to take a stand.  - Students seek understanding of complexities not just as academic pursuit but also in order to create a world view, one from which they will make commitments and choices.

BUST10152,Business Studies,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_bust.htm,"As division of labour, specialisation and differentiation are facts of social life, the question of coordination and integration of individual inputs is essential. Theories of collective action concern themselves with this question. Over centuries, collective action has been imagined differently - through a strong state (Leviathan), an invisible hand (markets), visible hands (hierarchical management) or institutional designs (rules, conventions and norms). In the first part of the course we will discuss these different forms of collective action critically and learn about their mechanisms, effects and sometimes unintended consequences. In the second part of the course we will open the debate and explore new forms of organising collective action. These new forms span public, private and third sectors and often address global societal challenges. They are enabled by technology, underpinned by social networks and use a variety of mechanisms (some old, some new) to enable a collective's capacity to act. We will study new forms of collective action with the aim to extend our intellectual toolbox and apply it to societal challenges.         Academic Description  In his recent book on collective action action Frederick Mayer suggested  that ""[t]he problem of collective action is perhaps the central problem of social life."" Several different disciplines have discussed modes of collective action using a variety of concepts and methods. This course provides an introduction into and critical engagement with these different traditions, touching upon the foundations of social theory. Moreover, the course will build on recent work in strategy, organisation theory and related disciplines to explore new forms of organizing and governing collective action.      Outline Content  Session 1: Introduction   Session 2: Invisible hand explanations: markets   Session 3: Visbible hand explanations: hierarchy and management  Session 4: Institutional explanations: rules, norms and conventions   Session 5: Emergent explanations: social movements   Session 6: New forms of distributed and collective action   Session 7: Organisation of distributed and collective action  Session 8: Strategies for distributed and collective action  Session 9: Leadership in distributed and collective action  Session 10: Conclusions    Student Learning Experience  The course will involve structured theory inputs in the  form of short lectures and combine them with interactive learning experiences such as case analyses, text-based group discussions, guest talks etc.   The case study will provide a real-world problem that shows the importance of strategies for collective action. The problem holder will brief you at the beginning of the course and will join you for the poster presentations. The problem holder will provide valuable feedback to the groups and discuss the feasibility of their ideas in practice. Possible problem holders are Festivals Edinburgh, the City of Edinburgh, a variety of social enterprises and others.

The course is taught and assessed in part through case studies, to develop your skills for conducting a strategic analysis of a business unit or significant issue within a firm so you can learn to formulate recommendations based on this analysis and communicate these recommendations persuasively. These skills are essential for gaining advantage in your job application process and in your future careers.          Coursework in the form of live hands-on projects with companies is the defining feature of the course. This enables you to investigate, analyse and present recommendations on, a strategic consulting project for management of a multinational, national or regional business. Senior executives will brief you on the challenges and the backgrounds to the projects in order to get you started, and you will be allocated to particular company projects and student teams, with a number of teams working in parallel on each project. You will also be supported and advised by practising management consultants from one of the world's leading consulting companies, as well as by professionals from one of the world's leading banks. They will make you aware of what is expected of your presentations and provide you with tips to shape your approach for your assessment.  Student Learning Experience  The course requires you to work through a number of online 'workbooks' prepared by the Course Organiser ahead of class, to guide you through the main theoretical constructs and issues; these require you to read sections of the set text, additional readings and short videos that amplify key learning points, and then to complete assessed multiple choice tests online. This enables the lecture sessions to take on more of a 'workshop' format examining critical issues in more depth and to enhance your understanding, as well as to allow guest lecture inputs. Allied to these you are required to work through a number of case studies in tutorials to help develop your individual and team-level analytic and presentation skills.   There is a single two-hour workshop and a one-hour small group tutorial or seminar most weeks. Importantly, you will also be allocated to teams and expected to contribute as a team member in tutorials and on the assessed team project. Your individual and team learning will be assessed through three activities: six pre-class tests associated with workbooks and readings; team corporate challenges in the format of a presentation; and a case-based 'take-home' essay (3,000 words) that will be completed in the examination period. The case will be released around the beginning of the December exam diet and will be due around the end of the exam diet.  The four learning outcomes for the Course have been mapped against these three means of assessment (available in the Course Handbook).  As detailed below (see Recent Developments), pre-class tests contribute to your assessed mark and working through online workbooks and readings and completing them upfront will help you to learn in a very different way: by first assimilating concepts from the reading and workbooks; enabling you to participate more effectively in lecture workshops so your understanding can be refined; and the immediate access to video material on real issues being addressed by C-suite executives (i.e. CEOs and heads of functions) will deepen your understanding as you progress. The videos are also important for enriching your thinking and answers, and giving you ideas you can potentially deploy in case studies in tutorials and team-level assessed Company Projects.  Companies will brief the class on their projects in week two, and at that point you will be allocated to projects in teams of c.five people and will be expected to work on them during the whole of the course to apply and demonstrate your learning. You will be assessed on this via a team presentation to a Panel in the penultimate week. There is also a take-home case-based essay on the course during the exam diet in December.

As a result of this digital transformation every business, regardless of size or sector, can utilize digital technologies (e.g. web, mobile, social media etc.) in its daily activities to reach its international consumer base online. This is possible, because the digital marketplace, unlike the traditional offline market, is not limited by countries¿ national borders. In order to capture the benefits arising from the online environment, however, marketers have to show the ability to use digital technologies and demonstrate the capability to strategically manage digital platforms in their efforts to achieve marketing objectives. Furthermore, marketers have to display a good understanding of the impact that international affairs have on digital strategies in order to fully capture aids deriving from access to the borderless marketplace.     This Strategic Digital Marketing course aims to introduce students to the digital marketing strategies planning process that will help them to take advantage of the growing opportunities deriving from digital platforms internationally. By the end of this course, students should be able to develop, implement, effectively manage and evaluate international digital marketing strategies.         Academic Description  Digital technologies are essential tools, which every business utilises in its daily operations in the 21st century. Such digital technologies, including but not limited to websites, mobile platforms and social media networks, open up access to the boundary-less marketplace, which offers endless opportunities to businesses. In order to take a full advantage of the digital marketplace, marketers have to (1) be able to use digital tools effectively and efficiently in their digital marketing strategies, and (2) recognise the impact of international affairs on those strategies development, implementation and management.    The course will give students a foundation for developing, implementing and managing digital marketing strategies internationally. Using a range of digital marketing theories, frameworks as well as tools and techniques, students will acquire knowledge and skills which will help them to achieve marketing objectives through the strategic management of digital touch points (i.e. web, mobile, social media, etc.). Furthermore, students will develop a sound knowledge of international affairs which have or might have direct impact on digital strategies, and they will learn how to use this knowledge to their advantage.     The specific learning aims of this course are as follows:   - Demonstrate an understanding of strategic marketing theories, and how they translate to digital environment. - Identify a sequence of key digital strategy development and implementation activities. - Evidence a detailed understanding of a range of digital marketing tools and techniques used for marketing purposes. - Demonstrate a thorough understanding of the role of digital technologies in the strategic marketing. - Demonstrate an understanding of international affairs, and their impact on digital strategies development, implementation and management.    Outline Content  The content of the course will be divided into three parts.   First you will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of strategic marketing, which when extended to online environment will form a base upon which digital strategies can be developed. The first section of the course therefore will include an introduction to various digital platforms as well as environmental factors that can affect international digital marketing strategy development and implementation.  The second part of the course will closely examine the development of digital strategies in an international context. This part of the course will be devoted to the development of digital marketing strategy plans. The implementation of various approaches to manage consumer online experience in international markets will also be discussed.  Finally, the third part of the course will focus on digital strategy implementation and evaluation.     Student Learning Experience  The course aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of a range of digital technologies as well as international issues, and their respective roles in international digital marketing strategies development, implementation and management. This will be achieved through lectures during which relevant concepts will be discussed. To further enhance your learning experience, academic theories and concepts will be supplemented by practitioners¿ perspectives delivered during a series of guest lectures. Students taking the course will be required to engage in independent study, which will include but will not be limited to an analysis of a case study.

The economy of developed nations (e.g. the UK, US, Canada and Australia) have shifted from being largely manufacturing to service based. Though services'  contribution to GDP and employment in these countries accounts for more than 60%, business school courses traditionally have focused on the manufacturing sector of the economy. This course, therefore, is designed to address this problem.         Interestingly, product-dominant firms are now turning into service companies; for example, services represent the primary growth for manufacturers like GE and IBM. Over half of IBM' s current revenues and over 60% of GE' s current profits come from services. The study of the marketing of services is important, as services marketing plays an important role in achieving competitive advantage. This relatively new Marketing Group course is being offered firstly to reflect the current trends in the services economy, in terms of how services contribute to more than half of our Gross Domestic Product, and secondly, to be considered as a platform for students who wish to pursue a career in the services industry (e.g. health, banking and hospitality).

It is designed to broaden students' view of services marketing, and to provide them with a comprehensive understanding of the unique characteristics of services and how services marketers and managers adopt marketing theory in practice. This understanding will be achieved by introducing, discussing, and analysing several topics important to service firms to ensure the achievement of customer satisfaction and the long-term success of the service organisation through the delivery of service excellence. Therefore, strategies used by successful services marketers to deal with issues such as service failure, inconsistent service quality, managing customer expectations, service innovation and services loyalty will be discussed.

With over 75% of employment in the service sector, the course is an essential asset for anyone planning a career in service industries, with relevance for consulting, retail, healthcare, hospitality, the arts, or financial services. The course also introduces the role of services in development, drawing from truly global case studies.           This course will explore the nature of services management and the distinctive challenges that it poses both for managers in this sector and for management theory. The sector (comprising both private and public sector services) covers such industries as finance and banking, accounting, consultancy, the arts and the media, retail, utilities, health-care and public services, tourism and hospitality, and leisure. It now comprises around 75% of employment in the developed world and 35-50% (and increasing quickly) in the developing world. Additionally 'service' has also been a key element of the profit equation for manufacturing firms. This makes understanding the nature of the service sector and the distinctive nature of its challenges essential for newly qualified graduates if they are going to have a strong position in the employment market. Moreover, service management presents distinctive challenges that contest much traditional management theory and provide an exciting new perspective on it for students. In the contemporary world, an understanding of service management is vital for the well-rounded management graduate.  This course will enable students to understand the distinctive nature of services management and of value creation in service delivery, to consider the key challenges for service managers in the sector and the skills that they require to address them, and to explore a range of approaches to successful service management for service businesses. It will directly address the employability of our undergraduates in this vital sector of national and global economies and equip them with the knowledge to function as effective managers in these sectors. This will be achieved by a mix of lecture inputs, visiting speakers, case study and experiential exercises, and course assessment intended to focus the student on applying service management theories and techniques to the real world.   Topics to be covered will include the nature of the service sector and its role in national and global economies, the co-creation of value in service delivery,  co-production and the role of the consumer in service delivery, designing effective services, strategic and marketing management in service businesses, the role of service staff in the service encounter, the impact of digital technology on service delivery, and evaluating quality and performance in service delivery.

The random selection will be conducted at 3pm on the Friday preceding the first teaching day of the semester - this will allow students to choose alternate courses should this be necessary. This means that students should have registered for the course (or emailed Professor Brian Main to that effect) before the deadline.  Any free spaces will be allocated at the first lecture (using the same algorithm among these second-round applicants).   Attendance at the first lecture is a condition of entry to the class.  This course addresses an area where many resource allocation decisions depend not on the outcome of market forces but on the interplay of bargaining between two or more groups.   Such situations may be found in purchasing a car, a carpet, or a house; in contracting for the services of a painter, a builder, or a plumber;  in determining the terms and conditions of one's individual employment;  in corporate take-overs;  in union-management agreements concerning groups of workers;  in free trade agreements within groups of countries;  in divorce settlements;  in setting regulatory conditions;  in determining the location of an environmentally dangerous facility;  and in many other areas of resource allocation.         Some of the important considerations that bear on such situations have long been understood in economics, e.g. the concept of reservation price.   Others are only now being addressed.  These new developments principally concern game theory and can be traced back to the work of Thomas Schelling as summarised in his The Strategy of Conflict.   More recent examples of this line of work can be found in Avinash Dixit and Barry Nalebuff's Thinking Strategically.  It has to be emphasised that this is not a course in game theory and does not pursue the theoretical approach.  The approach we will adopt here is more behavioural and applied.  This course attempts to recognise that the proper understanding of negotiation requires we go beyond the traditional boundaries of economics and management science, and address notions of bounded rationality, biases in decision making, social influence etc.   What is outlined here is not a course in game theory.  This course will place much greater emphasis on bounded rationality.   It will also make extensive use of role playing and group based simulations.

In each case you will be asked to sign-up for a particular role in a case, e.g. the buyer of a used car.   You will then be assigned to a ""team"", e.g. matched up with the seller of a used car.   Each team will have a physical area in which they can negotiate in privacy.  Sometimes the lecture theatre itself will suffice.  At other times you will be free to break out into other spaces.  Combining these exercises with a coffee break is fine (and, indeed, we shall see that social interaction plays an important part in negotiation), but please maintain your focus on the exercise at hand and return to the lecture theatre by the deadline set.  Late returns to class will miss the all-important 'de-briefing' component of the learning exercise.   Even more so than in other courses, attendance is essential.   As an important part of learning in this course comes through the role playing exercises you are strongly advised to attend all teaching and learning sessions.  Any student who, for whatever reason, fails to attend three or more of the teaching and learning sessions is advised to drop the course in favour of some alternative.

The course is designed to provide you with the necessary grounding in theory, as well as applied and organizational skills, to demonstrate that you will be successful in related career paths.         Academic Description: The course aims to deliver  the most important issues on Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring such as corporate divestitures. In particular, the course aims to develop your ability to critically understand and evaluate issues such as:   - Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring activities, the role of the business cycle in the economy and also the stock market development, in causing Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring activities.  - Regulatory and strategic considerations, takeover tactics, and takeover defences.  - Motives for Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring.  - Target firm and foreign target firm valuation.  - Issues developed through information economics that contribute on the negotiation and re-negotiation stage of corporate reforms such as M&As and divestitures.  - Empirical tests on the performance of merging and divesting firms at both the announcement- and the post-merger or integration period.  - Cross-border (cross-industry) acquisitions and their main differences with domestic (focused) ones.   The course relies on knowledge acquired from the Introduction to Corporate Finance or Principles of Finance courses in year 2 and covers the most recent developments from theoretical and empirical perspectives of Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring.   Outline Content:  The course will cover the following over ten two-hour sessions  - Introduction and overview of Mergers, Acquisitions, and Corporate Restructuring ¿ Activities, waves, and their theoretical perspectives.  -  Mergers, Acquisitions, and Divestitures strategies - Motives, implications, and alternative perspectives.  - Target (foreign target) and divesting firm valuation.  - Valuation of synergies.  -  Structuring corporate reforms and negotiations - Paying for the target firm & the investment banker perspectives.  - Value creation from M&As and Divestitures - Methods and evidence.   Student Learning Experience:  You will have to read the core textbooks that will support the learning outcomes of each topic/lecture, and also most of the additional references/readings that will accompany each topic. The weekly lectures will explore particular aspects of the course and the additional readings will attempt to help you put material in context, which will not substitute the core reading.   During lectures you will be asked to be active, completing exercises and discussing issues with your fellow students. In any case, the nature of the material means that in most cases there is not a single acceptable answer. The important aspect is that you are able to argue on a case and present compelling evidence to back your argument.

(This course was formerly entitled Mathematical Programming BUST10011.)         Optimisation problems are concerned with optimising an objective function subject to a set of constraints. When optimisation problems are translated in algebraic form, we refer to them as mathematical programs. Mathematical programming, as an area within Operational Research (OR), Management Science (MS) and Business Analytics (BA), is concerned with model building and strategies and methods for solving mathematical programs. In this course, we address model building in OR/MS/BA, present a variety of typical OR/MS/BA problems and their mathematical programming formulations, provide general tips on how to model managerial situations, and discuss solution strategies for a class of deterministic and/or under uncertainty problems. Last, but not least, students will learn how to use/build prescriptive analytics tools in the context of decision problems faced by business managers. The four main topics covered in this course are:  Syllabus  1. Introduction to OR/MS and Model Building;   2. Linear Programming (LP): Review of basic concepts and methods; namely, the simplex method and the dual simplex method, sensitivity analysis, and duality theory;   3. Integer Programming (IP): Basic concepts, relationship with linear programming, strategies and methods of solving integer programs; namely, brand-and-bound algorithms, cutting plane algorithms, and brand-and-cut algorithms;  4. Optimisation under Uncertainty: Basic concepts in two-stage stochastic programming and robust optimisation, relationship with deterministic equivalent formulations, and applications.   PLANNED STUDENT LEARNING EXPERIENCES This lecture and tutorial programme, which builds on knowledge from Management Science & Business Analytics courses in earlier years, develops mathematical programming model building and solution techniques, and is supported by mandatory readings and supervised discussion sessions. These supervised sessions aim at discussing how to put into practice the concepts and methods presented in the lectures and learned from the mandatory readings and the term projects. In addition, these sessions also serve as advice/support sessions so that students can seek feedback on their term projects work-in-progress. The student experience requires active learning and engagement, which requires students to read relevant chapters in the textbooks and other sources before attending classes. Students are required to complete three group projects using GAMS. Besides attending lectures and supervised discussion sessions (both of which are compulsory), students will work in groups on realistic projects (groups will be formed by the lecturer to reflect a heterogeneity of skills required for the projects) and present their work in class to an audience that may include practitioners and term project providers. Guest speakers might be invited for the benefit of students, however, students should not expect any hand-outs from the guests.

The complexities of the legal issues arising from employment are considerable.  It has become increasingly important that all organisational stakeholders such as managers, employees and trade unions, are familiar with the complex range of legal rights and obligations that surround the employment relationship.  Understanding the management of employment law is of considerable academic and practical relevance to students of management and organisation studies.         While we start from the assumption that recourse to the institutions of the law is a last resort for organisational actors, an understanding of the parameters and principles emanating from those institutions is crucial to successful organisational functioning.  This course will encourage students to think critically about the way in which the law both constrains and facilitates relationships between parties within work organisations, and its relationship to effective organisational functioning.  The course covers the following areas: the institutions of employment law; the contract of employment; implied rights and duties in the employment relationship; equality law; contractual variation, contractual breach and unfair dismissal.  Thus, the course will cover both the role of the common law in employer-employee relations, the existing (and expanding) statutory framework; the way in which relative standards of behaviour (for example, reasonableness or fairness) are interpreted and acted upon by tribunals and participants in organisations; critiques of law and practice in this area; how employers, employees and their representatives have positioned themselves in relation to existing and proposed developments in employment law; and the role of the law in contributing positively to the management of purposeful organisations.  Syllabus  - The framework of employment law: sources, institutions and context  - The contract of employment: terms and conditions of employment, employment status and continuity of employment - Workplace disputes and termination of employment by dismissal - Redundancy & TUPE - Pay & working time - Privacy and confidentiality in the workplace  - Discrimination 1: protected characteristics and prohibited conduct - Discrimination 2: discrimination in the employment context - Parental rights and work/life balance - Collective rights: trade unions & information and consultation   Student Learning Experience  The course comprises a mixture of formal lectures and group discussions.  The lecture programme will provide an overview of key issues, supported by a range of suggested readings.  Group discussions will focus upon understanding of the legal framework and its implications for organisational stakeholders, and on applying the legal framework to the problems confronting managers and employees in organisations.  Depending on student numbers, students may be given individual responsibility for analysing a particular case or issue, or applying their minds to hypothetical problems.  Students will be expected to participate in class discussions.  Questions for discussion will be distributed one week before each lecture and students may be asked to prepare a response to discuss at the lecture.  The course project will allow students to apply a wider range of existing material to a more narrowly defined topic in an organisational context in order to encourage the development of stronger evaluative, rather than descriptive, skills.

This course covers organisational design and development. The course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of organisational change via the theories and conceptual frameworks of organisation design and the principles and practices of organisational development. Both are critical to our understanding of organisations and how they function and both reside within a framework of organisation theory.         The course focuses on decisions that have to be made on the most appropriate organisational structure(s) to ensure dynamic delivery of organisational activities. Organisation design is about shaping an organisation to maximise its effectiveness; aiming for flexibility in delivery of its services. Through breaking down departmental barriers, seeking improved supply efficiencies, teamwork and collaboration and working towards better customer management and retention, organisations can enhance their performance and ensure that organisational goals and targets are achieved. Organisation design activities therefore focus on finding the most appropriate structures, relationships between departments and sections, and allocation of work activities, including definition of duties and role responsibilities. The module also focuses on how an organisation's culture, values and environment support and enhance organisational performance and adaptability.   Organisation development is defined as a 'planned and systematic approach to enabling sustained organisation performance through the involvement of its people'. This might include how organisational members acquire new skills, knowledge and behaviours, and do things differently, often as part of the application of continuous improvement strategies. The concept of the 'learning organisation' as one of a number of organisation development strategies that might be adopted as part organisational change activities is also explored.   Overall, the course aims to introduce students to a range of explanations that can help in the understanding of how organisations and their component groups and individuals approach change. In so doing, students will be encouraged to explore a range of practical techniques that can be used in dealing with change. The course requires critical reflection on theory and practice from an ethical and professional standpoint and provides opportunities for applied learning and continuous professional development.

Investment appraisal using DCF: We build on the foundations of Discounted Cash-Flow (DCF) analysis for the purposes of appraising corporate investment projects, and introduce tools that facilitate sensitivity analysis of corporate valuations.  Risk, return and the WACC: In this topic we look at ways in which corporations can measure risk exposures.  We divide risks up into market based and idiosyncratic and analyse the benefits of diversification.  We derive the relationship between a corporations risk profile and their weighted average cost of capital (WACC). We use the cost of capital as a key element in business valuation.  Capital Structure: We analyse how a corporation¿s mix of debt and equity affects its value.  We begin with a theoretical model and its predictions and we then introduce market frictions such as corporate taxes and financial distress and look at how these affect capital structure decisions.

Rather than a country-by-country account, which can be excessively descriptive and devoid of analytical cohesion, the course adopts a thematic approach. The chosen themes and topics are structured in order to address the theoretical frameworks and on-going debates in the fields of international HRM and comparative employment relations. Within this framework, the chief integrative theme is the current debate concerning whether employment relations systems and practices are converging or diverging on a global basis and the role played by global actors such as multinational corporations (MNCs).  The first section of the course begins with an overview of the divergent characteristics of national systems, the sources of such diversity, and how systems might be classified. The major controversy of convergence versus divergence of national employment relations systems is introduced, a theme developed through undertaking a more in-depth comparative analysis of 'national employment systems' specifically considering differences in liberal market economies and coordinated market economies as outlined by the Varieties of Capitalism framework.  The next section critically examines the myriad challenges that MNCs face in a highly complex international business context, and provides students with various theoretical frameworks to critically analyse and understand contemporary trends in international human resource management.

Yet the scope of retailing has been challenged by changes in consumption, technology, competition, and society. As a result, retailers have been forced to adapt to be successful. This course offers students the opportunity to study and understand retailing and how to address these challenges.         Academic Description  This course is designed to introduce students to key retailing principles and key terms, to complement other speciality courses, such as services marketing, brand culture, and financial services marketing. By the end of the course, students should be able to discuss current challenges and opportunities in retailing.    The course provides an overview of the organising principles and strategies applied by retailers in today's changing environment. Further, we will cover a wide spectrum of retail channels with a focus on creating seamless customer experiences while developing a competitive edge. Specifically, we will review multiple and omnichannel retailing as well as changes to the retail environment. We will emphasize decision-making processes for both consumers and retail managers. Finally, we will discuss the role of technology in retailing and how retailers incorporate new technologies into business strategies.   Outline Content   - Introduction to Retailing  - Types of Retailers and New Trends in Retailing   - Location  - Atmospherics  - Omnichannel Retailing  - Customer-Centric Mindset  - Retailing Strategies  - Merchandising  - Technology in retailing  - Luxury Retailing   Student Learning Experience  The lectures will introduce students to new theories, concepts, and topics related to retailing. Each lecture will provide at least one opportunity to engage with peers and discuss content. The small-group large-group discussion format will be a platform for making connections across content and getting the pulse for student learning.   Students will be put into groups in order to create a strategic retailing redesign. They will be allowed to select their own retailer. Students will analyse the retailer's overall competitive and customer strategy, and then make recommendations following the topics covered in the course. The groups will put together a report with the proposed 'look' and feel of the retailer. The group work will facilitate brainstorming and creative thinking skills, enabling students to consider different opportunities and sharpen their group communication skills. As the assessment focuses on coming up with potential ideas and developing that one idea, group work is recommended. Moreover, group work is naturally more conducive to promote creativity and can result in more efficient work.   Students will also be charged with an individual assignment in a case style. This will assess students' familiarity with the course material and individual critical thinking skills for a real business scenario. The assignment will be due within a week of release.

The course examines creative industries as cultural production systems by drawing on a variety of disciplines (economics, sociology, strategic management) and by utilising specific cases to understand their historical, cultural, structural and competitive dynamics. This course is available to both 3rd and 4th year students and focuses on organisational strategies and market systems for dealing with uncertainty and complex cultural products.         What do Spotify and the British Museum have in common? What processes led to the creation of molecular gastronomy and to the success of Cirque Du Soleil? Who can claim rights over a Banksy¿s work, given the anonymity of the artist? Exploring anwers to these and other questions, the course aims to introduce students to the basic dimensions that constitute a creative industry. The course is organized around key roles and concepts in cultural production systems. Creative industries may be purpose-driven, expressing ideas, identities, aesthetics and culture; they may be profit-driven, seeking commercial success and competitive advantage. Most of the time, they pursue both aims, in various combinations. Creative industries include large global corporations, public entities, entrepreneurial firms and individual creators. They may serve local markets, export their services or products, or link producers and consumers. They involve different actors and possess distinctive properties. We will draw on three sources of knowledge: 1) theoretical frameworks and research findings from sociology, economics, and strategy; 2) cases and media accounts of specific organisations, and 3) students' group analysis of selected organisations. We will discuss how value is created, organised, defined and protected; who are the actors involved in different creative industries; how creativity, innovation and change are made possible and sustainable; how knowledge from creative industries can be transferred to other business settings.  The course is client-based: in teams, you will work on a real problem faced by an important cultural organisation based in Edinburgh, and develop strategic recommendations to address their issues. The consulting challenge will require intense group work, high-quality output, and frequent engagement with the client and the lecturer.  In the first part of the course, as individuals, you will analyse the client organisation using the sociological and economic frameworks. Your analysis will be presented as a slide deck. From this knowledge base of the organisation, you will engage in a client project, which is the basis for second and third tasks.  Second, as a team, you will analyse challenges faced by the client organisation and develop strategies for addressing these challenges. As a team, you will seek sources of information, analyse data, and present your analysis to the client. The lecturer and client organisation will provide feedback on the presentation, to be carefully considered in the development of the final report (third task).  Third, each team will present their solutions to and write a report for the client offering an analysis of their challenges and strategies for addressing these challenges. Final reports will be submitted to the lecturer for assessment and feedback. Reports that meet a mark of 60 or above will be sent to the client by the lecturer. The client will provide a summary feedback on each team¿s report. The goal is to deliver a high-quality report to the client: content, design, and structure are expected to be in line with industry standards.

Both allow users to modify and transfer risks, take speculative positions, and develop investment strategies and the markets in which they are traded are significant elements of most advanced economies. Key questions as to their applications and pricing form a specialist area in finance. In particular, options involve the development of complex models for, pricing and monitoring their behaviour. A sub-element of the course will examine the use and pricing of interest rate and cross-currency swaps.         The Honours course Futures and Options is part of the suite of honours courses offered by the Business School in finance. It is normally taken in the third year of study of the MA degree at the University of Edinburgh, and is part of the finance progression stream. The course aims to provide students with the tools, knowledge and understanding of the derivative product set (that is, forward contracts, futures, swaps and options), how the instruments are priced, and the markets in which they are traded. The emphasis is on financial management and pricing. To integrate the discussion of these instruments, the course stresses the relationships that exist between the different instruments and, in particular, the various no-arbitrage and replication conditions that underlie the fair pricing of derivatives.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the classic work and latest developments in theory and research for a selection of marketing related topics, and in so doing, show the developments in understanding to an advanced level. As the essential reading for the course is based on articles from leading marketing journals which students read and critique in their own time, following guidance given in lectures, the course also aims to develop skills of independent thinking and critical reflection. In-class discussion questions and exercises supplement the reading to stimulate critical thinking and illustrate application of theories to practice and own experience.         Six topics are covered in the course: Development of the Marketing Concept; Market Orientation and the Firm; Marketing of Places; Marketing of Art and Culture; Ethical Dimensions of Marketing, and New Relations in Marketing. For each topic a set of background readings is recommended to help understanding of the main concepts and debates in the topic. Students are then directed to read deeply a selection of journal articles which contrast with each other in terms of approach and/or argument and/or managerial recommendations. Each topic is anchored around a key question, a fundamental question or concern facing theorists and practitioners involved in the topic - which provides a focus for learning about the topic and a starting point for critical thinking about the essential reading material. Each lecture session provides an introduction to a topic and an overview of the set journal articles, together with more in-depth treatment of 2-3 articles featured from the list. The sessions are designed to be interactive, with in-class discussion questions and opportunities for debate, therefore students are expected to familiarise themselves with the featured articles before each session. Assessment involves students undertaking critical reviews of the literature i.e. the set journal articles on the topics covered in the course.  Syllabus Introduction to the Course Critical Reading and Thinking Development of the Marketing Concept Market Orientation and the Firm Assignment Preparation Tutorial  Marketing of Places Marketing of Art and Culture Ethical Dimensions of Marketing New Relations in Marketing  Overall, the course aims to provide students not only with in-depth, subject-specific knowledge of the topics covered, but also with enhanced abilities to assimilate the key points of complex pieces of writing, and to question, challenge and critique them in a mature and reasoned way. The way in which the course is designed and delivered can improve general learning and study skills, helpful in terms of preparing for dissertations, essay based courses and work-related learning.

The Cultural and Creative Industries described by UK government as the Creative Industries are those industries 'which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property'. British fashion, architecture, publishing, craft and design, film and TV, video games and software, museums, theatre, dance, popular and classical music and visual arts are internationally recognized as world class. 1.7 million people work in these UK industries. Together they contribute almost £77bn in value added, equivalent to 5.0% of the UK economy. The latest DCMS estimates show that they grew by 9.9% in 2013, higher than any other sector. Allowing for the contribution of creative talent outside the creative industries, the creative economy's share may be approaching one-tenth of UK's economy.   Behind all these figures and within all these industries there are complex creative people, practices and processes and this brings distinct challenges, organisationally and managerially. Within this course we explore these complexities practically and theoretically.         This course seeks to give students an understanding of the cultural, social and economic importance of creativity and the creative industries, and insights into the organisational and management practices within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to insights into creative lives and creative work processes.  The course will have invited guest speakers from creative organisations and institutions, as well as academic specialists in the field of cultural and creative industries. The reflective learning practices and innovative, empirically based assessments aim to develop your practice-based skills for your future careers. In so doing this course aims to provide practically applicable knowledge and skills for those seeking to work within the cultural and creative industries, and organisations more generally - the practices that have been common in organisations in the cultural and creative industries are increasingly of particular relevance more broadly as organisations in other sectors seek to be creative, focused on performance, flexibly organised, work across organisational boundaries and engaged with customers/service users. This practice-based work will be done in conjunction with theory based learning i.e. theories of management in the creative industries, creative process, artistic and organisational practice within the cultural and creative industries, in addition to cultural entrepreneurship and leadership. Thus the course aims to provide an understanding of managing and organising creativity by interlinking theory and practice. Mutually productive links between theory and practice will be forged through reading and class examination of academic and practitioner literature; interdisciplinary learning with ECA cohorts; detailed analysis of particular examples and contexts; and engagement with industry partners.

The course considers aspects of financial management and the funding and governance of companies believed to be of academic interest and practical importance. The aims are to introduce students to current thinking and empirical research on the chosen topics, and to develop skills of understanding and analysis. The course builds on the corporate finance learned earlier in the degree programme, and so it assumes some knowledge of discounted cash flow, the cost of capital, and the main ideas relating to debt policy, dividend policy and raising equity. The course adds to students' knowledge mainly by introducing them to empirical research on the topics studied. Research in corporate finance is a social science. Its aim is to understand about value creation and financial decision-making as observed in the corporate sector. Students will learn about the current state of knowledge regarding each topic studied, and they will learn about how research in this field is conducted, through studying the research design of selected papers.

It does this by considering the meanings of brands and by outlining different brand strategies available to companies to both create meaning and meet the needs of consumers. We firstly explore the socio-cultural meaning of brands to equip students with an understanding of what a brand is, how they are used by consumers and from where their meaning is derived. With this grounding in place, we then move to explore the concepts of brand equity before discussing different approaches for managing brands.

Your business idea can either be for a social enterprise or for-profit. You can locate your business anywhere in the world.  Through sessions and group clinics, you will learn how to generate start-up ideas, and how to implement and execute your business idea.  Core to this fundamental entrepreneurial process is learning about the role of entrepreneurs, how to evaluate if there is a fit between your idea and your customer, how to build a start-up business model, sell and market your business idea, and what are the sources of finance for your entrepreneurial start-up.          Academic Description: Planning for a start-up is for first year students with limited or no experience of entrepreneurial processes. There is a particular emphasis on providing a practical hands-on approach to understanding how start-ups create, deliver and capture value for their customers.   Integral, therefore, is a systematic learning journey that first explains the entrepreneurial process and then, step-by-step, builds your understandings of how to generate business ideas, create a start-up business model, evaluate how you could sell and market your business idea, and subsequently fund the development of this business idea.   By the end of the course, you will be able to appreciate what is practically involved in setting up a start-up. This process gives you core skills in opportunity recognition, start-up business model development and working in a team setting to pitch and plan out how to go about pitching and planning a start-up idea.  Outline Content: Planning for a start-up will cover: - Introduction to the course - The Entrepreneur - Business Models - Idea generation - Product Market fit - Sales and Marketing  - Competition and Business Infrastructure - Sources of finance  - Financial plans  Student Learning Experience: To support the course's learning journey are a series of sessions and clinics.

Students will gain a theoretical and practical understanding of both opportunities and challenges facing these organisations with particular emphasis on how they create value, assess social impact and communicate with crucial stakeholders. In addition to relevant theories and concepts, the course will engage students through discussions with 3rd sector managers, reflective approaches to writing, and an interdisciplinary group project with 3-5 days 'in the field' at a 3rd sector organisation.  This Level 8 course is also open to year 1 students.         In recent years we have seen substantial growth in the number of '3rd sector' organisations such as social enterprises, B-corporations and other organisational forms whose primary organisational purpose is to further social and environmental objectives. Increasing interest is evidenced by the growth of events such as SE Career Days, Makeyourmark#, and student societies such as FreshSight. This course covers a range of issues relevant to 3rd sector organisations including:   1.Why the 3rd sector? The history and context of how and why 3rd sector organisations serve needs that are unmet by the private and governmental sectors. How do these organisations create value and generate impact for the community? 2.Understanding the stakeholder environment. These organisations compete in a complex political economic environment of diverse and often conflicting stakeholder demands. Understanding this environment is crucial for survival and growth. 3.Current issues in the 3rd sector. 3rd sector managers consistently face a number of issues including: procuring and allocating resources, measuring social impact and stakeholder communications.  This course has several features including:  (a) Learning engagement i. Practical contextualisation - discussions with guest speakers from Edinburgh's 3rd sector ii.

In addition, case study teaching (mainly in tutorials) is employed as a means of emphasising the interconnected nature of managerial processes and of drawing on actual organisational experience.  The compulsory weekly tutorials comprise a mixture of practical exercises, case study tasks and analysis of journal articles, and are used to provide opportunities to test and evaluate theories and techniques learned in lectures.  In addition, active participation in tutorials will lead to the development of analytical skills (through problem identification, data handling and critical thinking),decision making skills (generating alternative explanations, selecting decision criteria, evaluating alternatives, hypothesising on issues of implementation and consequences), and communication skills (listening to colleagues, constructing arguments, thinking on feet and convincing others).  As an innovation in recent years, students are now offered extended opportunities for individual learning.  By replacing one of the traditional weekly lectures with a guided individual learning session, it is intended that students will be able to study topics to a greater depth and in a more interactive manner.

In financial decision making these assessments comes to forefront and they are most explicit in pricing of assets traded in financial markets. This course aims to develop students understanding of the basic principles of financial markets and provides an introduction how assets are valued and traded in those markets.

Student Learning Experience:  Introduction to Financial Markets is an introductory finance course and has been structured in such a way as to assume no prior knowledge of finance. The student's success will be determined mostly by the time they invest in mastering the material.  Ideally the student: - Prepare for the lecture by reading the relevant a chapter(s). - Attend the lecture - Study the relevant chapter(s) after the lecture to put the lecture in context - Use the Bodie, Kane and Marcus website and other materials for self assessments - Dedicate serious time to work on the study questions before the tutorial - Participate in the tutorial - Revisit all study material before the exams  Finance is to a large extent an acquired way of thinking and some acquire this way of thinking faster than others (good numerical skills, but also common sense and talent help). Active engagement with multiple choices questions and exercises will improve the student's likelihood of success.  What may further help improve the student's skills beyond the study material is to read about financial markets in the real world (like the Financial Times) and apply the knowledge and insights from this course, or invest in (simulated) portfolios.

Innovation is a vital process in driving change at every level in society: organisations which fail to innovate may find themselves overtaken by competitors to the detriment of economic development and growth on a regional, national and international scale.  Innovation as a process is influenced not only by what happens at the level of the organisation but also by aspects of its external environment which constitute the broader innovation system, some of which may facilitate and others impede the process.  Innovation happens in both existing and newly emerging organisations when entrepreneurial thinkers leverage benefits from the external environment and marshal resources and internal capabilities to exploit opportunities, taking into account the risks.    This course will draw on theories of innovation and entrepreneurship to explore how effective organisations engage in these two strongly integrated processes, exploring, in particular, product, service and process innovation and demonstrating the role of innovation as a driver of organisational growth and development.

The course is designed to assist non-specialist students to acquire understanding of business organisations and management processes, and their relevance in complementing technical skills. The course is designed both to be self-contained for those who do not intend to study the subject further, and to complement Techniques of Management for Scientists and Engineers and other business courses that may be undertaken within Science and Engineering for accreditation purposes.         The course is divided into four modules: Economics, Marketing, The Management of Human Resources and Accounting. It seeks to provide an integrated introduction to the business environment, the nature of business organisations, the role of the manager and techniques relevant to management.  In addition to lectures there are four tutorial sessions at which attendance is compulsory. These are chiefly case study exercises designed to illustrate the more abstract concepts introduced in lectures, and must be prepared for in advance.  INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE Objectives To set out the structure and aim of the course, and to introduce the ideas around the creation of value by firms  Module 1: Economics Objectives To introduce some of the fundamental tools and concepts of microeconomics which are useful for solving economic problems and in assisting managerial decisions.   Aims To teach core principles in a way that is accessible to students with basic mathematical background (calculus) and none or little economic knowledge; to provide a tutorial which allows for the learning of economics through the practice of economics, to provide an examination which gives the appropriate incentive to students.

Organisations, commercial or otherwise, are the most ubiquitous of social entities, but the common denominator amongst all organisations is that they are operated by humans who need to be managed, i.e. directed, co-ordinated, monitored and controlled.  And it is the organisation of people in the workplace which constitutes the most basic management process.  Organisational Behaviour is the field of theory and practice concerning the management of human resources, extending the education of managers to the study of people, groups and their interactions within organisations.  AIM OF MODULE The task of this module of the Industrial Management course is not to provide a comprehensive overview of Organisational Behaviour which embodies a wide range of theories and approaches to the management of human behaviour in the workplace.  Instead, the purpose of this module is to offer an insight into the principal approaches that managers use in both manufacturing and service sector organisations to design work and manage employees, and to indicate the way that perspectives on such approaches are currently changing.

At the end of the module students will be aware of the relevance management accounting has within an organisation. Students will have understandings of the cost behaviour, which needs to be accounted when planning and budgeting. Students are also expected to understand the nature and purpose of the budget and be able to prepare a simple budget as well as analyse the achieved results in relation to the budgeted one.

There is much focus in lectures on practical examples, to help bridge understanding between theory and practice.  Tutorials are especially focused upon case-study methods to illustrate practical manifestations of concepts and techniques introduced in lectures.

BUST08027,Business Studies,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_bust.htm,"This course examines the nature and meaning of human resource management (HRM) set against the backdrop of institutional frameworks, recent changes in the economy and the labour market as well as contemporary organisational strategies. It has both a UK and an international focus and it treats HRM as a blanket term to describe the employment relationship in any organisation rather than focusing on HRM as a particular style of management. The course draws heavily on research analysing contemporary developments in HRM and employment, and wherever possible we draw out implications for real-life organisations and HR policy and practice.         The course focuses on a number of key themes to provide a critical flavour of the subject.  We adopt a broadly critical approach by i) questioning whether HRM leads to beneficial outcomes for workers as well as for employers and society and ii) offering insight into the practical and conceptual significance of change processes currently affecting HRM in Britain and overseas.    HRM 2 is especially suited to those who want an introduction to HRM and employment issues and are taking it as part of a degree programme where an understanding of HRM is seen as an important complement to their specialist studies.  As such, it is appropriate for students from a diverse range of backgrounds - offering a critical (and essential) overview of HRM for students working towards a business degree as well as offering an essential foundational perspective for students studying for the Business with HRM degree.  Following an overview of the economic and labour market context, the impact of key stakeholders (i.e. management, unions, the State, and global actors such as the EU and multinationals) on organisations and HRM policy formulation and practice is examined in detail.  The remainder of the course considers HRM in key practice areas such as recruitment and selection; training and development; performance management; remuneration; work-life balance; workplace discipline; career management; and equality and diversity.  Syllabus  Introduction: The Economic & Labour Market Context  SECTION 1: KEY STAKEHOLDERS Key Stakeholders 1: Management - Best practice/high commitment approach to HRM - Best fit/Resource based view of HRM Key Stakeholders 2: Trade Unions - Trade unions & collective bargaining Key Stakeholders 3: The State - A feature of employment law: National Minimum Wage Key Stakeholders 4: Global Actors - European Work Councils - Information & Consultation with Employees - Multinationals & HRM  SECTION 2: MANAGING EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS & HRM - Recruitment and selection - HRM & Employer branding - Remuneration systems - Equality & diversity - Work-life balance - Training & development - Workplace discipline, grievance and dismissal - Employee involvement & engagement - Managing Careers - Managing Conflict  Student Learning Experience  The formal lectures provide an overview of the essential features of the subject, together with guidance on the content of recommended reading and current sources of additional information.  Given the contemporary nature of the subject, reliance is placed upon current periodicals as the chief source of reading material (a range of top quality titles such as Human Resource Management, Journal of Management Studies, British Journal of Industrial Relations etc.) are recommended.   The weekly tutorial topics are detailed in the course booklet. Attendance at tutorials is compulsory.  At each meeting one student/a small group of students will be responsible for preparing and presenting the tutorial topic as a basis for subsequent group discussion.  Topics are allocated in advance to allow adequate preparation, and include predominantly focus on organisational case studies in order to allow students to consider lecture material from the practitioner angle. However, other approaches such as Web-based projects and practical and literature-based exercises have also been incorporated to enhance students' learning experience through tutorial discussions.  In addition, students are required to submit an essay from one of two essay titles, on key management topics and/or debates.

While both aims are pursued simultaneously through the semester, the ""transition"" element is specifically addressed with skills lectures and components to acclimatise students to university learning, and how to achieve positive university outcomes. The business component is addressed through consideration of topics such as digital, environmental and social disruption facing business, and trends including consumption and the future of work. By applying the skills to the topics, students learn the importance and value of critical thinking, discussion, and argument.  This course is open to students studying degree programmes in the Business School and degree programmes where the second subject is Business; students on other degree programmes should take Introduction to Business (BUST08026)         To achieve the twofold aim of this course, it is designed to engage with the following academic topics:  Transition to university learning, covering topics including: oWorking in teams: the benefits, the difficulties, and how to overcome these; oQuality of Argument: what is an argument, what is a strong line of reasoning, how is it relevant in a business context? oStrength of Evidence: what are credible and reliable sources of evidence, how do we know, how do we find and use them? oClarity of Communication: how can we present arguments and evidence clearly and persuasively, what are different presenting formats (eg written and oral) and how do they differ?  Business in a global context with topics taught including (although these may vary based on dominant and pressing issues which emerge): oUnderstanding Business (its roles and responsibilities in society; traditional forms of organising and the implications of these; alternative organisational forms and their traction in society); oDigital Disruption (digital advances and impacts on firm structures and practices; emergence of new business models such as the shift of a collaborative economy; enablement and empowerment versus loss of jobs and alienation); oGlobalisation (the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and mutual sharing; advances in transportation, telecoms, internet, mobile; implications of these for trade, transactions, economic and cultural development; the movement of people and dissemination of knowledge including winners and losers from this process); oEnvironmental disruption (including climate change, water, energy, food and clear air; how this creates uncertainty and opportunity; impacts on resource insecurity; market shifts and their implications); oChanges in Consumption (growth of emerging economies; markets at the bottom of the pyramid; consequences of demographic changes; rethinking consumption and the movement to an 'experience' economy); oNew Forms of Work (changing expectations of 'work' especially relating to generational shifts, implications of digital disruption on engaging workers, implications of issues including digital disruption and global inequality on workers' rights and conditions; role of leadership in this changing context).

This course introduces you to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. It focuses specifically on how and why some innovations are successfully commercialized, with particular emphasis on the role of the innovator-entrepreneur, with specific reference to science-driven innovation relevant to your programmes of study.         Entrepreneurship has become one of the most powerful and influential forces of change in the world. Technological innovation driven by scientific research has led to radical social and economic changes. Companies like Apple, Facebook, Genentech, and Cisco, all derive their success in part due to the innovative application of novel technology. But advanced technology alone is not sufficient to guarantee either user adoption or commercial success. Many ideas and technologies are abandoned or ignored despite presenting apparently significant advantages over incumbent systems.  This course introduces students to the theory and practice of entrepreneurship. It focuses specifically on how and why some innovations are successfully commercialised, with particular emphasis on the role of the innovator-entrepreneur, with specific reference to science-driven innovation relevant to students programmes of study.

Entrepreneurial activities 9. Leadership and social entrepreneurship  10. Exits and outcomes   A fundamental outcome of entrepreneurship is the creation of new value, usually through the creation of new products and services which may lead to the creation of a new business entity. The objective of this course is to demonstrate and understand that exploiting a new opportunity is a process that can be planned, resourced, and managed. To start a successful business, an entrepreneur must exercise motivation as well as enterprising and managerial skills. He or she requires access to resources to grow the business; not just investment but social resources as well. Overall success is not just related to the nature of market opportunities but to the entrepreneurial and managerial motivations and skills of the entrepreneur.

Supporting student development of knowledge and skill related to success in entrepreneurial activity 3. Encouraging student self-evaluation with regard to entrepreneurial interest, intent, and capabilities.  This course utilizes multiple learning modes, including: independent reading, primary research, lecture, group discussion, case studies, and exposure to practice.

A SLICC requires you to propose, develop and manage a unique learning experience that will enable you to evidence how you have achieved the learning outcomes of the course.   Your self-designed learning experience is required to adhere to a defined structure that supports and enables you to self-direct and manage your own learning experience. Within this structure however, you have limitless possibilities regarding the topic or theme, content of study and nature of your experience, provided your proposal is academically feasible and is approved by the course organiser.  A SLICC, for example, may be based upon a particular learning opportunity such as an internship, work experience, pro-bono activity, community engagement, volunteering, or study-abroad and may also focus on a theme of personal and/or professional interest such as sustainability, social responsibility, equality and cultural diversity, or a disciplinary or interdisciplinary-based research theme.  The steps in undertaking a SLICC are as follows: 1)Identify a suitable opportunity within which to undertake your learning experience 2)Write your draft proposal and submit to the course organiser for approval 3)Self-direct and manage your own learning experience 4)Actively and regularly reflect upon and document your experience with evidence and use that as a basis for writing your self-critical 'Interim Reflective Report', then your 'Final Reflective Report' 5)Formatively self-assess and submit your  'Final Reflective Report' for summative assessment by the course organiser.  The steps identified above each require a significant amount of thought and input and will ultimately form part of a 'time-based' e-portfolio of evidence, which will be used in the assessment of your SLICC.  Undertaking a SLICC you will not only develop the content of your learning experience but also produce an agreed portfolio of outputs where you must evidence what you have learned and, importantly, where you demonstrate how you met the learning outcomes for the course.  If you have undertaken a SLICC in Year 1, you must clearly indicate how your learning in this later SLICC is different from, and/or builds upon your learning from your first SLICC.  Students should attend designated SLICC induction workshop 'Understanding your SLICC and getting it started', prior to submitting their proposal for review and approval. There is also a requirement to maintain an online blog for the duration of the learning experience indicating continuous self-critical reflection on progress.

BUST08031,Business Studies,http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/20-21/dpt/cx_sb_bust.htm,"Business Simulation is a practical, integrative business course that requires teams of students to operate a simulated start-up business. Acting as a board of directors, students set the direction for the company to build up the business by making decisions related to its strategy, finance, market, operations, staffing and innovation. It aims to foster interdisciplinary decision-making in an inexact environment and to prepare students for the problems and issues of working in a changing and uncertain world. This course has a quota of 120 students.         Business Simulation is built around a computer-based business simulation of a technology company start-up. Students on the course are formed into company teams of six or so members who will self-allocate themselves into the different board of director roles (Strategy, Finance, Marketing, Operations, HR/Organisation and Innovation) to manage their simulated company through a series of five simulation rounds that represent two years in the life of the company.  The purpose of the course is to provide an experiential learning environment where the connectivity of the different functions within a business is made explicit. Students will have the opportunity to apply their learning from the earlier elements of their degree programme to the problems presented by the simulation; and are required to develop the business, justifying and reporting the decisions they make for their simulated firm.  Students will also learn via taught classes each week. These will cover (in the order indicated below) the various business functions that relate to running a business, focusing initially on lessons drawn from the simulated environment then introducing guest lectures where a practitioner will present a talk about their business experience. This provides a link between the theoretical and practical nature of business management and background and context for the various company groups in managing their business start-ups.

Students are formed into groups of six to be the managers of a business start-up where they have to make the necessary strategic, marketing, financial, operational and organisational decisions for their start-up and throughout the course of the simulation which over the duration of the course will represent two years of the business' operations. Group interactions allow students to learn about the issues surrounding teamwork, effective leadership and the development of social skills within organisations.

Note that the Business School also offers an alternative introductory accounting course, Accounting for Business 1 (ACCN 08012) which covers aspects of both financial and management accounting over one semester, but not the double-entry accounting system.  Syllabus:  Recording business transactions into the accounting equation and into the double-entry system (Debit and Credit.) Recognition and measurement principles relating to non-current (fixed) assets, current assets and liabilities. Issues relating to ownership interest /equity. Preparation of financial statements (income statements and statements of financial position, changes in equity and cash flows)  Evaluating performance using ratio analysis Ensuring the quality of financial statements, the regulatory environment  The Annual Report - Presentation of published financial statements with notes and narrative reports. Forensic/investigative Accounting;  fraud vs. creative accounting.   Student Learning Experience: Students will experience the identification and evaluation of different ways of learning including the assimilation of presented material, structured and free choice reading, interaction with staff and other students, practice by doing, use of learning facilities such as library and IT support. While the collaboration with others in the learning process is encouraged the enhancement of independent learning and self-management in finding, organising, assimilating information and in applying this knowledge is central to the course.  Tutorials supplement the material covered in lectures.  These consist of groups of around 14 students, engaging in weekly sessions facilitated by a tutor.  Students prepare for the tutorial by completing quizzes, practical exercises and/or reviewing annual report extracts or other reading assignments for review/discussion during the session.The tutor is an important link with the class work and is there to help you in your learning.    Working through practical exercises is an essential part of learning accounting.  Certain lecturer led activities are structured as workshop sessions where the class will be involved in solving a set of practical exercises.
